You know that what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or leather clothes, and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that you fell somewhere.
You just have to give the apple to look at it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the complicated kind of circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle of the middle school, in the middle school, Ohio where I was the rare class.
When I went to bleeding every week in the bathroom of kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me enter the bathroom of the teachers.
I did it in secret.
for three years.
I had to move out of the city.
I had a thumb, and it was about 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working on organizations that fight against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we adults never come to us.
You could <unk> Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to stick with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, and we find it and take care of her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to be <unk> as a adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box and went on my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked about this.
It also needs -- it needs to be dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separate from nature and everything.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly be <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them down to my water <unk> almost 60 feet away, and I couldn't think that it was about a <unk> about another <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall from glaciers or they break the walls of ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold it up to the end, whereas others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, as we see ourselves as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As you melts a <unk> I'm breathing your atmosphere <unk>
As a iceberg melts it releases freshwater cold water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it comes out of my ancestors, and knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not a end, but a continuation of its path for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's a little bit frequent to really get to see a <unk> iceberg actually.
Here it is.
You can see the left one boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg in size.
It goes from water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so we <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one <unk> a baby.
So, two couples each one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if they stop to think about the conception of yes, they're not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is attached to the X <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is attached to the X <unk>
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity in my ground to get two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a training of training, and what I study in this case is the way people look at the anatomy -- that of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body <unk> the idea of <unk> what have you thought of about the body.
The other role that performance on my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins two people inside the same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physics typology doesn't fit into male and female <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I'm going to give you a few examples of ways to have an sex that doesn't fit into the common or physical forms of male or <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual with the <unk> <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene from the chromosome and tells you to the <unk> that we all have in the life that you have in your life -- you get <unk>
And then, in life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual doesn't react to testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a result, the body develops following a <unk> course <unk>
When you <unk> the baby looks like a little girl.
It's a child. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it is growing up and developing <unk> but it doesn't have the time period, when you realize something is happening.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like this.
Women, as men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who doesn't know its structure -- I think it will be a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We create <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who have <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way can be everywhere.
Another example, a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> I had girlfriend, and sex with her, he had a life as a boy and had just figured out he had <unk> and <unk>
He had a extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had been <unk> and in the uterus, the areolar glands were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, his genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component is typically the male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19 when it started to have criminal medical problems by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in it.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with <unk> chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> is to say, they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that kids with this kind of bodies are going to be <unk> <unk> twins or <unk> or <unk> <unk> surgeries -- not to be able to have a better physical health of a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why you get to a number of surgeries that are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy bring <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- it will be black wants to say to have African anatomy in terms of historical terms.
Very simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of a very romantic <unk>
Imagine the amazing thing that you have children are born like two people in a same body.
The highest case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his sex <unk>
A lot of journalists called to ask, "What do you test to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you the journalists that there is not such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't traces a <unk> line between men and women and between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more of the science, the more we have to admit that these categories were categories of <unk> <unk> categories that were <unk> directly with <unk> <unk> <unk> are a lot more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
And also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science we get more and more in a <unk> area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all of the spheres of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes a human and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know inside of <unk> to when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never got to do with this question of whether somebody was dead.
As a lot of a <unk> put a pen in front of the nose and she was still <unk>
If I stopped moving down the <unk>
But we can, for example, we can take vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a dilemma of determining really death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you might think that this explosion of categories might be happy like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies -- but I have to admit that makes me nervous.
And so we would argue that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
<unk> from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of my parents, <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, which I find every bit of watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
This is what happened in <unk> with whom I am. <unk>
I know I know it was <unk> to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> with another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as they all remember, what our parents are, <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs on the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue <unk>
It was from the idea that was going to be political power by the right of blood that was passed by the father of the father and then to the son, etc.
I know I know that I was rejected that idea and replace it for a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were a part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And it remains very clear, if you look at the story of the Founding <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> of the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to <unk> that is a vague idea of the right.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence and they talk about nature and God from nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And there were a consequence of a consequence of the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think of that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women were <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people of the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights Movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people in color that are going to be <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Movement, <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we need to start asking why we hold certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should take it to anatomy.
I don't mean that for kids five years to be allowed to have sex or married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me have sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things: I would see at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time, June 1, 1980.
So Henry, for the other hand, was born on the other one March March 1980.
For the fact that we had been born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right of the right consent to the vote, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different age, but because it was born.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, just by virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you if it is <unk> by virtue of being considered man now is <unk> of the responsibility that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So we still get <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up to the science, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of a <unk> <unk> "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people got stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a certain time has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to be <unk> and to marry a woman you have to have Y.
Now, in practice you don't do testing testing people.
But this is also very strange because of the story that I told you to the beginning of <unk> <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people who are <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should take care of human rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some of the <unk> <unk> that you probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more decisions and smart people on their sexual relations than I know.
So how do you put the theme of <unk> content.
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me wonder what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current idea of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels like for other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless he is willing to engage with a change for sex, whose case is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that there was actually going to give birth <unk> <unk> to pick them down, and then they <unk> their name.
But when the phone asked her the reason for the operation, he was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum seekers rather than <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people who are <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to end up, I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what the democracy would be like democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given greater participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a bit radical for a feminist, and it's that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, because I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sex difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who I knew I was interested in my feminism <unk> I thought <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has the <unk> of <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, the more has something like there's something <unk> in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if I know myself, they were very attentive to find the way to protect people from the state, it is possible that, to have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that is what we need to do in the future when we celebrate democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a <unk> <unk> let's think about what each other ones do.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family think where every family wants to go live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, at this point, we're far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell a single city to <unk>
But the amazing thing about the cities is that it's worth a lot more than their cost of building work.
So we could easily spread to the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just <unk> by buildings.
Imagine that half of those people who would like to live in apartments -- they were the owners and the other half is still <unk> to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to increase in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you pick, is that those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to avoid the length and the distractions for the construction of the construction.
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a totally new place, and build a completely new apartment building always and when the rules of that place will grow the construction instead of putting it up.
So I proposed that governments to add new zones of reform enough to hold cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of solving Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened for a constitutional crisis.
In the next presidential election, <unk> <unk> was called a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same reconciliation.
He asked <unk> to be his boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say you can't go and engage all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to the new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies as a set of rules to <unk> and usually they're the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a hotel room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York <unk> terrain that in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain a <unk> which will take the rules out there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> was called, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, and this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to go out and talk about new four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which was to explain that to take a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site which is about 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
The whole world is <unk>
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The <unk> leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed up the <unk>
And this explained to you, that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go to <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government would need help from <unk> countries, they could benefit from the countries that help them to build and make the rules of the <unk> so that they could all rely on the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could be easily <unk> a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the October of January, <unk> in Congress to <unk> their constitution, and to add a constitutional arrangement that would allow to create these special regions of development.
In a country that I had just passed through this crisis -- the voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the parties, all the <unk> in society, <unk>
To <unk> in the constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
The February of February was passed again in a voting and voting on one.
And immediately after the voting on the top of 21 to 24 of February, it was the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center in the city that is building in Korea in Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after four years to get the <unk>
The other interested country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> to allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban <unk> of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you have already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are many companies who wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say that they would like to change the other place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to get a job work, sometimes they have to win the money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what seems to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or to build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to be thinking about <unk> that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public <unk> and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photograph and publish on my blog suits and colorful and different <unk> for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> shops.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to know people -- <unk> people usually go to a good <unk> My money is going to be <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I would like the color to love it.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I'm going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I would see.
I've brought seven pairs of within, and nothing else.
So on the inside of a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I figured it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after you get to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know that the woman who walks up at TED in underwear,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with a Sunday night.
I call this a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You can almost always see for less than 50 dollars.
All the aggregate, including <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is power is energy.
It's almost impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you also get <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you take in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remind you about their <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look well with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood the meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your interior and outside, there's no look at you can't look at it.
So there's no excuses.
We should be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal universal truth for you: The golden <unk> are going to do everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again, when people approached me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave some of the certain things.
I don't need to focus on these things, because on the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I think.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who's completely logical.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider me one of those people, who just like most quantum physicists <unk> we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them and then we see how we <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a form of intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is that one thing can be just in a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing in a parking conversation.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, it was always <unk>
But I bet I play with that bar of a parking lot taught him a precious lesson, and it is that great things will not allow us to have the <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist -- because they don't play with car bars, they play with these little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe those small particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logical side.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't keep the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why I shouldn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to extend it a little bit. It's right at the center.
And then here we do a good focus on the small <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal with a springboard shape, and that <unk> supported on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip, and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a swimming way that you find under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum element, but it needs a bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird stuff, but then when other people go up to stop doing those things, because I don't want them to tell them, or, actually, I want them to <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The peers on the journey of inanimate objects are not only the light and the wind that happens to its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to keep all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
He <unk> the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and pulled all the air, and then they put it up to a temperature of less than zero absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little metal of metal is free to act like that.
So we measured their motions.
We found that it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way it was to be <unk> it was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when you give him a <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and that doesn't go to the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing is <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every single trillion atoms that make up that metal of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's just in particular <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which it means that all the metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because look at this, the difference on the scale between one single atom and that little metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places. Why don't you too?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was embedded in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it up, and we turned the lights down, and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal kept there on one piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are simply <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that truth.
It's more profound than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my boss that is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and <unk>
And so many negotiations and stories, they will do it with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There are a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explained by this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and art work.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
Better to show you the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've taken out of their launch.
So, let's go to <unk>
Look around all of the museums there.
There's the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, in the <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move out there and get it wrong.
They want to navigate through the <unk>
We opened the flat on the top, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're in the inside, you want to go at the end of the room.
They're still going on, which is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million <unk>
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see things that are happening.
I love this guy, your expression has no price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems to be <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And I was talking about a little bit, I talked to some people in the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and you can see that you can really get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to remove the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is coming, a second.
So now we're quickly going to jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find detail.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this work <unk>
It increases it and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is "the night <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things more here, but I don't have any time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you that day.
You can actually create your own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we have created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we've just got a zooming around it.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery in London.
You can write things, send you to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things do not come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experiment with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to its work and it's represented properly online.
And the great question I do today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon to everyone.
I've got something to show you.
Think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture in the wall of her bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has been a really interesting thing in the course of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
Just some time, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, take a budget and put it into a good car and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what engineering -- in engineering, the control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronic electronics.
They're going back to the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to answer differently, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note aside, I wanted to say that cities are only two percent of the planet crust, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and until 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be big.
Beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost all of the existing atoms in the existing atoms they get sensors and <unk>
And that is changing completely by the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense it's almost like in the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end he took the hammer and threw it on the Moses -- actually you can still see a little <unk> a <unk> and he said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk> And so what didn't you <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> insisting on the idea of taking the environment and we run something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup.
Maybe some of the remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day looking at activity happens in the Web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's morning, before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
At the afternoon early there are people around here and doing call <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France. <unk> in Italy.
<unk> people do a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They make Italy, yeah!
That night all went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day they were at the center of the winner of the winner and the first minister of the prime minister then.
And then everybody else <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the spike at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but things that we use and we consume it.
Today we know all about the side of our objects.
So this is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how it gets <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags, to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than one year, to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all like to be <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with a lot less energy.
These are data that we didn't exist.
They are going on things complicated and there's lots of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> it isn't still anywhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle left a day still still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and a lot of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is run on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology can technology, the new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a garage, was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It creates like a <unk> water <unk>
If the pixels go down, you can write in them, show patterns, images, images, texts.
And if you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can see, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
I liked it.
And <unk> a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no doors no windows, but when you come up and it opens up so you can pass it up.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there is a bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down.
Or you can close the building and all architecture disappears, like this case.
There will always be somebody, in the winter when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down, most of the architecture goes down.
This is how it works.
You see people going through what happens in it.
And here I am just trying not to <unk> the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact there was a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was going to open up to leave you over, but a building that was still making slices and water holes and one had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of use people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air and you have a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which is moving with others in sync.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the position of the night.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And that then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D, where you can get close and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When light turns out, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of the people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> from the best dancers of ballet ballet <unk> the <unk> star of New York and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the capture in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can spread all the movement.
You can go around the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as an possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last two years, is that, in the last two decades, we spent from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, as knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign will be <unk> we can move from the digital world of our self-organizing power, of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, collectively, itself.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with the rise.
You can move inside, you have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve the main moments of the 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can rise, as a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and safe from ourselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe you're from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is they going to tell you.
What if you would like, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people would argue, creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> Probably the number of creative people have been there.
That's very good.
How many would you choose the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something from this, the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference today, but today I want to give you the look of a physician on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the <unk> Church wrote an essay called "No biology in biology makes sense except for light from <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Does us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well in one end, it is, of course, the most interest to us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
And there has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is the <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the intestine more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> is asked by the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm hot and dark, dark, <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want without any effort of your part.
It's really a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some hurry <unk> towards the output.
But therefore we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we tell us the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something maybe better <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and the human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I was just <unk> to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental about that most fundamental existence in the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms every cell simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters cells.
But when organisms appear together, things start to change.
It enters the scene sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the death of the body enters evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student -- I was thinking, well, <unk> death -- it seemed like a reasonable thing at the time, but with every year that was happening, I was more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a little <unk> dancer.
He looks at him and he says, <unk> it looks for a <unk> of <unk>
It's fine. He says, George, I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to feel healthy.
I wanted to restore health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more more healthy.
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view of view, you and I are as <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic load to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think that all <unk> the feeling that put Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution not necessarily favors longevity.
They don't necessarily match the bigger or the stronger or the faster and even the more smart.
Evolution favors the very best adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that we <unk> if there were fish there, fish removed the <unk> yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we look at the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward, the <unk> phase -- I would say there are lots of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking would be that through medicine, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> of the population.
And second, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we get so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation needs to happen.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of the traditional traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when we were kind of <unk> distant planets are going to exist, and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, and intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose at the individual and familiar.
Think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to do the genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes for eliminating diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating it.
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year we had finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
You can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 and a week.
Not enough to make the human genome actually for <unk> and getting more and more to all of us all.
They come to those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us but are going to induce against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine inside of a <unk> plant.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's really today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two little <unk>
They can change cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give their kids a better chance of a life to remove the diabetes, remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to be able to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> <unk> especially if you were able to <unk> with the next generation of the machine machine.
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are on the planet conditions, this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally it could take 100 thousand years, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or their grandchildren are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices in a better society, more successful, more successful society.
Or, we're going to choose to selectively make different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that's more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For worse, and before what I could do is these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Sounds frightening.
Well, I had a single seat that day was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing I could talk to the flight flight.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
It's usually not the road.
It takes off the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The top three words I heard of.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in your eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do before they die, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in, and I didn't know -- all the fences I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines ...
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is the while I took the George Washington, which was not very much -- I thought about, Wow, I feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity also gave up to my <unk>
And I am sorry for the time that I was thinking about things that didn't matter to people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship, with my friends, with people.
And then as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm no longer trying to be <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental clock is going to be <unk> by 14th <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be breaks in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of Wow, it's dying it's not afraid.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell you, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade -- not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> as a small one.
And to me, that was all the reason for being the world.
At that point, I understood the two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was given a miracle, not die that day.
And I was given another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You who are flying today, the challenge that you imagine the same is on your plane -- and please don't be like that, but imagine, and how do you get it?
What is it that they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and negative energy?
And most importantly, are the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to her house after he ran and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has a total paralysis
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so that, obviously, the graffiti is something <unk> which we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "Wait a second, not that you would have seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important and you have a safe insurance thing you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, is making it <unk> with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented to the only wish to deliver a check, and rather than that he wrote a check, he didn't have the least idea of how he was going to <unk>
I joined her brother and her father there at that precise moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk to you -- we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to get back to do his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on your inner cannot be able to <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project light on any surface, and then with a laser rate, you do about that and register negative space.
So you go around by doing art facilities like this.
All the things that they <unk> they say, they're part of a cycle of life.
First start with the sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks at the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a cycle of life in <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a long year later, after a lot of organization and so much to move things from one side to another one we had made a couple of things.
One, we touch the doors of insurance companies, and we got a machine that <unk> could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And, seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to you with the guy who gets email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the <unk> world of all the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were born, they would have removed the walls of the walls and they would have been <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> of <unk> my son was side, and we created this.
It's called <unk>
They are a pair of sunglasses that we bought in the shipping side of <unk> Beach, some copper juice and things from television and <unk> and <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we set it up on an LED light -- and there's a device for free -- and you can now build it -- we release the computer code down, the software goes down for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company saying "No."
There is no hospital that can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much to you. That's impressive.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And then more than a year of planning two weeks of programming had been intense sessions from all night, Tony came to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and it's looking through the support system.
I ran the bed to the bed so I could see.
And we put a slide on a wall of the parking lot.
And he came back to me for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot so that we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
And at the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I would draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and would get me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream of war.
That's what keeps us on motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device -- but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it, and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, the Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 previous inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up closing the <unk> is that April of this year in the <unk> of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
Nothing in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything like this room.
I am not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology I just recognized something and made me <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you to do all of us every day when we find something that we feel that you need to do. If it's not now -- and if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you, guys.
I've spent the last few years, in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> hard and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just a little bit of fun at the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been focusing on very awful situations with the only goal of trying to look at social issues in ways that <unk> interesting, interesting, and, hopefully analyzing it in a way that you can see useful and accessible for the audience.
So when I knew I was going to come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I got out of a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered my rights to the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content I could do and according to the content I could do in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said that, it's a very good <unk>
Do you know how much people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would not have been able to do it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the marketing world of advertising.
And as I said before, I was in horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could surprise me -- nothing could be done for something as hard or as dangerous as I go into the rooms with these types.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that I try to do a film -- and the marketing and advertising, and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to be called "The biggest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The biggest film ever <unk> is that everything up to the bottom, it has a brand, all the time; all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were going to spread to the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk> it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not only going to have the <unk> brand in the title but we're going to make sure it <unk> all of the categories that we can on the film.
Maybe we would take a shoe, and it becomes the most cool shoe.
The most cool car has driven on "The greatest <unk> ever <unk> the best shot you have <unk> <unk> of "The greatest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then besides showing you the brands as part of the life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> making it <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the last filmed is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this film.
That is the full idea, all the <unk> of beginning to end.
And I would love to help us make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you were <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> You don't know David <unk> How much money does it take to do this?
MS: A million and a half a <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them, but certainly it's going to be worth convincing a couple of big brand.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the film comes to us as a lot of <unk> idiots going on.
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: So two things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I thought, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome. Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: So I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies disappeared.
No wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, it was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people would see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the <unk> media scenario is not the idea to tell you with that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> mistake and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such thing."
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for <unk> images on Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that show you.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the bigger problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even <unk> even <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it really changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives you <unk>  like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want them to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want to take a story, but we want to make it <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there he is looking at me as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, and there's my story, and it's <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wants to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take it to the <unk> and go to the companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to figure out of suddenly -- and that I started to ask you is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, giant movies, giant films and other people who make small movies like small independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood movies -- giant Hollywood movies, say the reason why their movies have so successful is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The biggest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically in the film?
Every time I'm coming out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you good for this <unk>
You ready? You look a little bit nervous.
I want to help you to help you.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there you offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> are going to have its opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like to make it solid, to <unk> to <unk> like it.
That's the general moment.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> the kind of <unk> movies that we were <unk> we are rather <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: That's higher technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put into the <unk>
Man: We talk about something audacious, cool.
I think it's a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do you keep you fresh longer?
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the man from the street, people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good eyes.
Woman: They revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, lots of gray colors, so much like this.
Usually I wear <unk> <unk> or I like the crystals and the similar.
Woman: If Dan was a brand a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am. I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman #2: I mean, rather <unk> partly <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the type of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out because he <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk> brand.
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand <unk> but I often get stuck at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you think about how people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come together and start in a place and in my case where they come and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk?
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: That's how I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things. I like the weird thing.
A: Tell me about the <unk> so what do you do that?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be frightened. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience, <unk> Big <unk> A: <unk>
MS: Yeah, I don't know what it's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness all over this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> your Morgan Morgan <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were getting very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only be governed by one of their strong points or in the other rather than focus on both.
Many companies tend to avoid the things that they're not <unk> to avoid the fear, those elements, and you are actually <unk> you and you make something a positive positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are like this?
The first here is the classic <unk>
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come into it, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A brand <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to raise your brand, your brand, your brand, which would be?
You're a <unk> <unk> you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful as <unk> being fresh as the contemporary <unk> <unk> and audacious as <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical as <unk>
Or are you rather <unk> <unk>
You are a sophisticated <unk> like <unk>
You're physical, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're reliable, stable, <unk> <unk> safe, sacred, or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they had no control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how it is now using magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for film marketing in the brain.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising in the air.
In the entire city over the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts where corporations are getting a way in the schools in schools in the United States.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I have had the biggest answer or where I've had more successful are those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took away their donor agencies, and they said maybe these agencies are not my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that will make people think about how to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did he gone? They did success?
Well, since the film was released at the <unk> Let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions of media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> or press and TV or TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies that we talked about, to their customers won't be part.
I have always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that there are opportunities.
I think when you get people out of that, it's pushing them into failure.
I think when you train your employees in loss loss <unk> it's preparing all your company for <unk>
I feel like what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to not fear the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Now more than never a little honesty is going to go through a long way.
And I said to that, with honesty and transparency, all my whole talk, <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> great data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on behalf of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's an extraordinary question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization, the Foundation, Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my assistance for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are in real time.
If we can engage these systems that are controlling speeds and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software is a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a <unk> virus to put a laptop from Windows in a laptop to set up this gray box, so we are ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows <unk>
The <unk> enters the gray box, damages the <unk> and the Google nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk>
It looked like to do something with these <unk> boxes -- these control systems.
And that called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we went to the <unk> environment, and we saw what happened with this.
So they got very strange.
<unk> was <unk> like a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> and wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after I experience with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at actively in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it's actually working on that place.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be, let's say for example, a power plant in the U.S. or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better that we would get to the goal soon.
And then we pulled out the attack, and we discovered the attack, and we found out that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were armed with very <unk> people who obviously had the whole internal information.
We will take all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know it.
And if you've heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very much over everything we've ever seen before.
Here you see a sample from this attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning was called functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to <unk> with the real world, with real potential for the real world.
We need to do theories about <unk> that we can pass or pass it on.
To get to theories about goals, we remember it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them in an effort to <unk> his experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that kind of cell phone inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to do slow and <unk> in one obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We are trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very closely at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number of <unk> <unk> on that code, you can't get it.
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better <unk>
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in front of them.
And so that there is not <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been from several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would say to one single digital and same thing, but from different perspectives.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six fire and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other targets to be <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, I really got stuck.
There is the gray box and the top, you see the <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the input values for example, with pressure sensors and vibration sensors and provide vibration code, which still runs during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, this data from false input are <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies, where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed up <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not do quickly.
For example, in an energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes down, you have to open escape escape in a <unk>
Obviously this can't do a human operator for course.
That's where we need digital safety systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can explode.
And neither of the <unk> no security system was <unk>
It scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in an energy plant, or in a <unk> factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have any <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technologies for <unk>
It would be more possible.
And if you made that, with what we <unk> is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All of the green areas are spaces with great numbers of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better than we start preparing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the reverse superpower here.
There's one itself, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you, <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can take you and give <unk> skills, or another thing that makes users of the wheels go up and go back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that you put in in the morning, gives you a big force -- that also increases your speed, and help, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect with the universe and with other things that are going on.
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now in what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier who, on average, you must take on their back a <unk> load of 45 pounds, and it's going to be allowed to get even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injury in the back 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage of it.
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can <unk> 90 pounds of land for a lot of hours.
Your flexible design, allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's look at the look at the users of travel, about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people here, on the rest of the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation of it.
We talk about something that happens often, people very young people, with the column that will start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only choice.
We also talk about the population that is aging very quickly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who did 19 years ago in the neocortical column, and as a result he couldn't walk back for 19 years old now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has a few sensors.
It doesn't completely <unk> in your crutches who send signals to the computer computer here on the back.
There is also some batteries that give power to the engines in the <unk> and on the knees, and do it move through this soft soft and very wild.
AB: I was 24 at the top of my life, when, for a stranger jump in the air, skiing down the bottom was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and everything from <unk> down.
Shortly after, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never come up to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So he stole until the last ounce of hope of my self.
<unk> technology has been allowed to learn to <unk> it costs the bottom on <unk> climbing rocks and even riding <unk>
But you haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talking to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the future of future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of <unk> to all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins and cousins.
This is the world of the <unk> of the forests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest relatives.
That means we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary ancestor an evolutionary ancestor which lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too focused on this aspect of what our human evolution looks like.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where the mortal violence is still not yet yet.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest, and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an element of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> a violent conflict that has been held over by decades and caused almost so many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation do you cannot fill or a stadium with the bonobos with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure that.
However, on this land of violence and chaos you can hear the hidden laughter -- the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the apes <unk> the love, not <unk> because they have sex <unk> <unk> and <unk> to handle conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love playing throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a child's game.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish ties and foster <unk>
With him we learn how to <unk> and learn the rules of the game.
<unk> increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo you can see the roots very <unk> themselves of laughter and dance and humans.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of random videos.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about soccer ...
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as much in bonobos as humans.
And this video really is interesting because it shows this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to the game -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and promotes the <unk> and at the same time it's the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> you can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who's playing with fresh water.
I think that as her, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form is the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that the Bonobo gives us of our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a more and harder world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these skills.
In other words, play is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But let's go back to the most of our own game?
The game is not <unk>
Play is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems to be the least appropriate thing to play, you can be the moments that it is more <unk>
So for that, fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> <unk> as a captain of the captain of a volunteer body, volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers are giving a highly skilled staff to get to the site that was very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a career standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner who certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing out in the rain, under a <unk> in her home, and he was in fire.
The other volunteer that I had just gotten before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked him to go out and save the dog owner.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, he would have to tell people that I went into a <unk> building to save a <unk> just because she won me for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get home.
I need it to be <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall went to the fire <unk> that kind of ended up the fire or less of the fire and walked into the main room in search of a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden back to the ladder where I met my <unk> and the gorgeous dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house, the treasures for your home owner where, as you would expect, his treasure got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of the house <unk> for the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over what else was someone had reached a pair of shoes.
And so much in my calling on <unk> <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer firefighter witness is the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also with grace and courage to individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who have made, or are you to get it to -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: I don't hang on.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, I'm going to stop now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody else's life, but every day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So they trained to the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back. Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I am a great fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks built in <unk> with a very simple idea, of cement in a fixed measure that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges or bridges or a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
He was called <unk>
And in a few years, the building blocks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've been made over 400 billion or 75 building per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> I simply took the block of the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic building piled around each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex circuits a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference that the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each one with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they get together via magnets.
So you can't get in a wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the wind, the rose is the <unk> and the color of color is <unk>
So you only have to assemble a blue one, and very quickly you can start to make larger circuits.
A blue one in green you produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
And we would take this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, they're actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple technologies.
To do you faster or smarter, you just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world <unk> ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given kids to see them to play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light at night, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also taken <unk> to design schools.
So, for example, designers without any electronic experience, they start playing with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island that they don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, "Let's do something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, an cannon of <unk> turned movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that he's afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and forth.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking to get involved with the environment focused on.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on the side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, it's already a term about time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technical designers to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to work in, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like about <unk> for <unk>
We were giving up some members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them into the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
His task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> to <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I looked for a date, but what you really look for is that somebody will clean it when it stays on the snow, because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time we were spending a lot last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens would have <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application that you can take a <unk>
You accepts <unk> when you <unk>
When you do it, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications that happened last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads upside down.
A responsible for systems in the city of <unk> to see this app realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to get to <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people would steal the batteries.
So it asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were going.
So now we know about nine cities that we will use using using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> in natural and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done for the normal canals it would have taken at least two and a half million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there's a project in the power of California that until the moment has gone over, 2,000 billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that gets in a couple of days and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shot of warning.
It suggests the government better ways to work, not as in private companies, as a lot of people think it should be.
Neither as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, in form open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents a way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's really good because it turns out that we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't been giving up with government.
Do you feel like a great frustration to that, but not <unk> it <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we just leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that make us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they alone don't know.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
<unk> not <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately <unk> from -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect how to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to be <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of telephone care and information center.
It's the place that serves calls if you mark <unk> in America.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the official of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, to put music really hard and see if it <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a center of calls.
It has a web and a mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
You don't have that application.
It was the work of the very smart people in the Office of New York City <unk> in Boston.
One day, this really came up with this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> it's all public, so you can all see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the cube garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went back to the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the U.S. income to collaboration distributed distributed collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I talk about a platform for people to join and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had an key role.
He connected the two people.
And it could have connected with the government services of being needed but the neighbor is a better and cheapest alternative than government services.
When one neighbor helps another one, we would bring the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people <unk> but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will embrace our values and make our needs but then we don't see the changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface <unk> <unk>
It's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which holds us that it belongs to us that we actually have to put in our against, that other thing, and the consequence of we're missing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work on, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real government works.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
You've got them <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the request of the financial reform project on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us that we have taken care of the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we get to where we have to go without fixing the institution that can act on behalf of all?
We can't do yet. We need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act -- you just have to articulate systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, and I, to <unk> I'm a greater generation than a lot of them.
This is a generation that has grown up with the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to kill you, they're all going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem, you don't really care about how to hear their voices.
They're using hands.
They bring their hands to work to program applications that do better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking away from dumping a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
We certainly could have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are as a digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that; we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get to <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or also we will be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons. prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities -- in projects and places where there is a lot of desperation.
And I will be here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are being said here are impact on the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that I wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is a big deal.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can do much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really know this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was <unk> it was strong, it had power.
It was the last word in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery and <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was <unk> but she was also <unk>
When I was a little bit of it, she looked at me and gave me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then I was <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and I was approaching me, <unk> still feel my <unk>
And if I was saying no, no, I went back again and if I said yes, I was left peace.
I had this human quality that I would always wish I was near it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to get your time and your attention.
My cousins was running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first, I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it, and I was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went down through the room, and she said, "Come on. We're both going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside, and he said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I was <unk> I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you do?"
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "Only I want you to give me three things, you know.
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to say it always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yeah, <unk> <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you will always do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought to him, and I said, "Yeah, <unk> So <unk>
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that I never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South Africa, I have a brother a bigger year and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14, 15, one day my brother came home with a package of six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just got <unk> <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take you <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today, and you always do the same thing as we are.
I already took something, your sister also.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I came up with the eyes of strength and <unk> "Oh, it's not going to be you're thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I will tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I'm saying it by the power she has the identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to the other that they really don't look like.
We can't get them to do things that don't think of being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that it was, according to her, we would have to <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate of the world.
We have seven million people on parole.
And this massive <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor people, or black, you find so much <unk> so new, determined by these facts.
One of every three black men between the 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In the urban <unk> across the country, Los Philadelphia, Baltimore in Washington, from 50 to 60 percent of all the color young people are in jail or parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a criminal system that is much better if you're rich and guilty that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is going to affect the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not problems.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some really curious.
In my state in Alabama, as in Alabama, in other states, you get paid care for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has lost definitely the right to voting.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years to the loss of the loss of being as high as the law of the right to the vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where it was a 13-year-old year to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for kids, without possibility of coming out again.
Right now, we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people has identified one who is innocent and liberated from death row.
A error of error, <unk> a innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it could never be allowed to fly airplanes if in every nine <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to World War II.
We really don't know much about this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was a bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I was worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his life.
Now there are more people coming to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell talks, you tell talks, it makes talks, <unk> people to stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The terrorism age went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> racial and separation.
In this country, we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we would go with each other.
We're constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany, giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's well disturbing to listen to what I <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to get it here."
The room was silent, and a lady said, "There is no way that with our history, we could ever get to the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> and <unk> we were to run the people."
<unk> about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We could not do it <unk>
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you actually don't care about these hard issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are embedded in suffering, the abuse, the abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my mind, you need to integrate both of those.
lately lately we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more <unk> with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never get to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that's inside of us.
It's true that we need to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so deeply engaged with intellectual,
With innovation, with creativity. The development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection to your heart is what drives us not just how brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the difficult.
<unk> <unk> the great leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for the spirit, a will to be in places and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I believe, that even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no related disconnect with technology and design, which allows us to truly be human if we don't pay for the attention to poverty, to <unk> for injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege as a young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> I called me to say, <unk> comes Mrs. <unk> We're going to bring us to speak.
Do you want to come and look at it.
I said, "I do."
And then she said, "Well what are you going to do when you go <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the <unk> of life, without freedom for the children.
We try to do something about death penalty enough.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and at the end of me and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> <unk> put me on the face on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst thing we've ever met.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
This is why I think there is a basic dignity in the people that should be <unk> by law.
I also think in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's it.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that although it's very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge our technology, for our designs, or our intellectual and rational ability.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they treat the rich and powerful and <unk> but in the way they treat the poor, they give them the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes too much strength.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my customers in 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> to be inspired by the adults themselves.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge to turn someone into what isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
I was very late at night -- I was awake at God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
Like it was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I was 14 years old, a little black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my 14 year-old <unk> is treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk>
In <unk> I put there there were been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it, but he'd sent it to court.
They spent about two months, I had already forgotten.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got up to the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. He walked into court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> it was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who's you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you. I said yes.
And then I came up and I was surprised.
And I told myself in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
So that deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> And we started coming.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the prosecutors the prosecutors <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people; I all am talking about races, because we talked about race, because we talked about inequality.
I had the <unk> of the eye on the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I looked out the window and you would hear all that <unk>
I'm going to be walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black man with <unk> walked into the room and sat behind me almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge was <unk> a <unk>
And during the break a <unk> assistant was like, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black one.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood up, he looked up at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, "Get this audiences out to tell this young man to keep his view in the target with <unk>
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
We can't really be human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is attached to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity should be addressed to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you here who share this, I just want to tell you to keep your view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: To hear and see an obvious desire to the audience, from this community, to help in your way, to do something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to make an effort in which a effort is going to be spent on the funding of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the cases of homicide is not <unk> in <unk>
The rapes don't come to anything.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to be made to make the law for security.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, you say it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you who you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's for the wrong war.
That's why this is why this dramatic rise in the <unk> population.
And we let ourselves convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes, to bring people to the supply chain to steal a bicycle -- by little crimes against property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months -- could you be the last six days or for the last six years.
The idea is that the press media prefer to <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting many, many more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters to us than to survive, the first stop to all of those data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us damage.
So for that of a <unk> stories, looking at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe what really happens is that we get <unk>
Maybe the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance over the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the <unk> of water and <unk> without any doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long time, we just have them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has become more than <unk> average income per capita fixed by inflation has <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people did it.
And we continue to <unk> <unk>
In fact, we will recognize the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the past century, the <unk> on the planet would never have dreamed of such a <unk>
It was a lot of the technology and then lately, exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that would be <unk> on information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubles the price of the price for about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the cell phone have in your pocket is a million times cheaper than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, soft that is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession in <unk> depression and <unk>
It's the transmit of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the great challenges.
And although it's <unk> on a law on the left, it goes up to the top.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The <unk> in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, the robotics, 3D printing and will distribute personalized production, all over the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels and food and food, digital medicine and <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked for the newspapers the best headline than he <unk>
And I loved this:
So "Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
He plays the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach them these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a <unk> or a service or service, which can affect positive affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have a absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that which is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
Do you have dinner the king of <unk>
<unk> troops are filled with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on Earth, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason the tip of the site to Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, doesn't come as the <unk>
It's tied up for the oxygen and the <unk>
But then it came to the <unk> and he made aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet that is about 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there are good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that shows that the end of the decade, in American parts of the United States, solar power will cost six cents an hour compared to 15 cents in national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
So let's talk about the wars for water.
Remember that Carl Sagan has pointed to the Voyager Voyager toward the Earth, in 1990, after he passed off.
<unk> a famous <unk> How does it come from?
"A <unk> point.
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent per water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> of the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology available not 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a single refrigerator size.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of water drinking water on the day of any <unk> water source, <unk> water -- for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola is just known to do a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes up well, and I have full confidence in which it will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan was 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smart smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton is 15 years ago.
He lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid for tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> images, images of books and music, technology technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes to when it comes to your health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to bring these technologies into a mobile device with which you speak, and because it has <unk> you can get blood from the finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the <unk> charge is 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this device is <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that won't be able to call the United Nations <unk> and, first of all, avoid the epidemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of <unk>
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We have just spent the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give to the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never seen before you get to the global conversation.
What would these people want to do?
What <unk> What <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy of Khan Academy -- and because of using impressions 3D and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three billion members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about the voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the revolutions wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and power for the first time?
What are these 3,000 billion?
And if you are contributions that we can't afford it.
One thing I learned with the X Prize, is that small, guided by their passion with an objective of course, can do things -- they can do things that were only able to do great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end by sharing a story that really <unk> me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing about medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They played with this university professors among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a tremendous confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> of the <unk>
We have the capital <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are happening to us to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
They actually <unk> fish.
And they described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
I caught it very much until the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and elsewhere, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The dots are still saying they are still <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, too."
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned very much with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 centimeter <unk> <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and it was going on for a good time, so it was made over the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the amount of fish had gone down in half.
I went to five centimeters.
We <unk> a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish are still happy to be there.
So nothing to changed, but it's all changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of the <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development came to impose to the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, a pretty cool thing, called <unk> 4.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the south of the South China, and mostly in the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> I know -- the bottom of the sea.
90 percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are tiny, tiny blobs that are a coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very quickly.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The bottom happens to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
It was still not <unk>
Then they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they've never fish.
But I have no <unk>
We don't remember it.
They took the start to begin to start on the start to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have things that are <unk> biodiversity, many of them, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time, changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the images of <unk> at the beginning of their conscious life as they normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the kind of change.
And at the end of the end, keeping a few <unk> remains.
And that, as well as we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they were anymore.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done until about generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't miss <unk> animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea with big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
With time you have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, scientists, that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, isn't the way they would expect that to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like captain like captain such as a captain of the fish in this area cannot be used or usually not use the scientists of fish, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies, because they don't trust the sources.
From there the enormous role that you can see a protected area.
Because with marine protected areas, we really see the past.
<unk> the past that people can't think about because the starting point is run and it's very low.
That's for people that you can see a protected protected area and can benefit from the vision that we <unk> which allows them to erase their baseline.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the Middle <unk> for example?
I think there are the arts and cinema maybe you can fill the void.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the harbor <unk> 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you go with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a certain sense, has been lost.
That's why my <unk> the only thing to give, is Cameron, I do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today, we will see why the videos are made up and what important it has to be.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper forever in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can be done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
You go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of these, just a small percentage of the percentage gets viral gets a lot of visits and gains <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this <unk> video outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> of the popular summer last summer.
<unk> was not meant to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already posted many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I would <unk> the video.
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented to us new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, you have to start on a Friday.   Everybody wants to get on the end of week, the weekend of week.   KA: Would you think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it about 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this <unk>
Well, I took them <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or an creators group embrace a view of view, and share it with a broader public <unk> accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this great intern in the intern then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for every one of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation.
That's it.
This year, you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats seeing the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that I woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an version of the old one.
And then it was international <unk>
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a stupid joke to something that we can all form of.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What do you script might have written that <unk>
In a world where two days of video goes up, just that really only thing and unexpected can come back in the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind that protest against the <unk> in New York, I admit that I didn't really get interested in it.
Casey <unk> I <unk> for the <unk> but there are often obstacles that prevent you circular with the <unk>
KA: Thank you to the surprise effect, and its humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth everything that we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities are creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new media of a new media -- that we all have access and is the audience that defines as popular.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't want permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> from our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics -- it's just the current means of the current media -- but we will understand the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been completely in vain.
The words, for so much time friends, is now going to be <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was trying to <unk> but I did it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls away.
For her, life had been applied to a <unk> assignment the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that it defies fiction, a boat was attached to the sea dressed in <unk> ship.
All adults know the risks.
The biggest fear was the cops and the rape and death.
Like most adults -- my mother had been a <unk> with poison.
If we first took it out, we would first take it to my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the engine, the <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast and empty way.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not be able to pluck for six hours.
But I know the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died. Look at the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I <unk> given for the men from the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over generations by giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is composed of prisoners.
Unlike the middle suburbs whose existence was <unk> I had no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English fragments among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six or double <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a bachelors degree of <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and that an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, it wouldn't do what it should be <unk> which was usually clothes -- it was always <unk>
Two pairs of average for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there was rare and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home."
So at home, in what?
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I lie in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were amazed on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until their nightmares are going to be able to be able to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do their transition and angry and <unk> and kids were trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in worlds parallel.
In one, I was the classic <unk> relentless student with what I was talking about myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, substance and isolation.
But many people got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyers, I picked up the young Australian Australian <unk>
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of the <unk>
So <unk> resident anonymously in <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire into the <unk> and to the happy life in a <unk> suburb -- a mother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had the same age that she had when she got up to the ship.
The "no" had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, and you don't know what not <unk>
So I talked about the juvenile and education and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly, I was talking about it was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they would live on the border of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown, a newly <unk> new scene in the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that you're grateful, perhaps a ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily make the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave them enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will be <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that they wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a power there, a <unk> optimism -- a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
You know, a little group of people who <unk> <unk> cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant array of soup that all <unk>
They go back to the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy but some brilliant, and we open us up.
I made the decision to move to the United States.
after a single journey.
My <unk>
Three months later I had <unk> and the adventure was born.
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
By 17, it became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of your husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to take the cause her, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
And it can't be done by the way it proved wrong.
I was in the shower in the fourth of a hotel in <unk> when she died.
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw him standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, later, we went to a Buddhist temple, in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you take your hand from the <unk> he said.
<unk> have no <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life we built in, we can now see that the men who would have come to our lives would have <unk>
The defeat would be easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could that wish for you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, diving brave in every wave, the constant rhythm of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and see it, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of what's here today, in the fourth or a fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the old Indian <unk> <unk>
In those days when Indians want to travel <unk> to a cart in the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when we <unk> the great Prince Prince Indian, I was <unk> it took a bow and a <unk> to the ground, I got water.
Now we do the same thing with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we got was that the machinery had replaced with the magic.
And that gave me a lot of a lot.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was struck by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to let the magic <unk>
As a girl my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of 50 years was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers.
I had the feeling that mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and cameras prevent it from <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a <unk> device capable of connecting readers to the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where are we are.
<unk> the text with the image, animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what does that do for us?
I'm about to launch <unk> an application for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back a character in the book.
At many times, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where it is alive thanks to GPS -- which comes led to me.
My inner girl gets excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, and those ideas that I teach of children.
For some reason, firefly in a jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad up to liberate fireflies.
And, you know, you light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy would be stuck in a <unk>
So here every book and every single world gets into a <unk> that I <unk> to this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all of the fantasy I've always been mapping but have been aesthetic maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts know the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been stuck in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk>
So we are bringing them back in a single child <unk>
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> glued to their <unk> they have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out outside the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
As a kid I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids aren't doing it.
So to restore this childhood ritual you have to go out and, in a chapter, you have a picture of a flower to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is how you create a digital digital collection that you can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
One child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variations of connecting between magic, the Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on and through an augmented reality to see a <unk> group that appear on the inner plants in the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves leaves out.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature are associated with technology and magic and technology are coming to each other.
The power of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to the CEO of listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee, or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that we all do, or maybe not all of them, but most of the projects of <unk> they would have since we stop listening.
This is my scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> and out of it.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I was <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my <unk> doctor has access to him too. And so he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time that it needs support, or <unk> or some urgency of that style, but to look at it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers, on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi and <unk> and before I go up to my car -- people start to speak up today, I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it is pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and so that patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some activity in order to have more control of their health.
From next week, we will be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would go from their homes, to take their blood pressure, they will take their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients take a position, they get to recover control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health because of the challenges that we face, as the firing cost of attention is <unk> the demand for demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage the patients on the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things that we did want to share with you with a video video.
We all have <unk> controls in <unk>
Maybe even we have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs are ATMs in <unk>
But where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains of course.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We did not have any <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public audience, you see a <unk> please make them <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> in the office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use your cell phone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to look at the world level.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we will help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> worldwide.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relatives, or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in its place.
Please forgive us in this and not only improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> <unk>
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
It mixed up with my earlier passion, but it was a bit different because when I use the camera the process was in planning on the process.
And when you take a photograph with a camera and the process ends up when you press the <unk>
For me, photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that started to press the <unk>
It was like this: a construction in a very <unk> highway.
But it has a twist on it.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at once but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something I can <unk> but I always want you to look captured in some way like photography.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It's got more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem <unk>
They're the details or the <unk>
Have you put on light?
What is it that creates <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is that it's realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if I existed.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So, you get to the brain because the brain doesn't accepts the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the pictures.
It's really combining different <unk>
And the things that make a picture seem realistic I think they're those in which we don't even get the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining pictures it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I would like to say there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the <unk> pictures must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning, and the end of the various images with perfect memory.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is <unk>
Here's another example.
You might think that this is a picture of a landscape and the bottom part is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of pictures of different places.
I think that it's easier to create a place that will find out because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try and find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> part was just captured on a stone.
And yes, even I made the top of the top of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome of it, I think we need planning to make an realistic outcome.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures of the result it can be very beautiful and at the same time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram any one I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details -- but the general way.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as many other ones we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale. <unk>
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the performance scale.
I'm talking about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something strange.
And that's precisely what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn on the lights.
It gets more intensity because writing about paper.
So why do we <unk> technological curves at <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to give you the diagram would see something ludicrous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you look at it, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we see a straight line.
But if something happens to something like this, it gives a <unk> change.
If technology is <unk> as fast as <unk> last morning we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development of an growth growth that every few years of advance orders of magnitude.
The question that I want to do is -- look at these <unk> curves that we see not forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
We would have one of two things.
Or it's okay to become a typical curve, I know like this until it comes to something totally different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, is, what is that new way you take the world?
What new state is going on the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happened in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel like something is going on.
And a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how that transition could be <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at the long-term things.
The time scale I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So you go back to a half two billion years when the Earth was a great <unk> rock with lots of chemicals going around it.
If we look at the way that we organize those chemicals give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there's theories to begin to understand the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there was a little bit of floating around oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet had been a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring up the outside of the outside and so the drops of growing up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most exciting cell forms that those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense because each one of them contained a random recipe for chemists.
And every time you get <unk> <unk> a distribution of chemical <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow became better at the time to incorporate chemical <unk> more <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
They usually lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, or a very simple chemistry, but things get interesting when these drops is really interesting when these drops of the abstraction.
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learn to hold information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this endless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that system of writing seems to have remained stable since it evolved 2.5 billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living thing is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> We can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> white powder that I'm trying to hide with the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and you would find it 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card from my personal card -- I have lots of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells become happy about a billion years.
But then another great step in which things are going to be very different, and it was that these cells started exchanging and communicating information into the cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
That way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found their way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they would form communities that, in a way, they were together, and they set up a <unk>
It <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community will become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came to both that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities -- communities from many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have lots of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't use without the heart, or the one of the muscles or the brain and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These began to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not at time of evolutionary time.
So an organism could tell, for example, to learn how to eat some fruit, because I knew bad and got sick last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system actually built those information structures that we actually accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea in the head.
I'm here sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads that holds some analogy to mine.
But we took something very complicated to make it on the sound of sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
We now go through periods of periods like <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> <unk> the audio tape, the <unk> and so on, it's the specialized mechanisms that we built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in vain.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program.
And now we have accelerated time time again.
The first stages of history I told you about a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> language etc., they took less than a million years.
And the next one, like electronics, it seems to be just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that leverages its own pace of change.
The more changes, the more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make a life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that job to <unk> would not be possible without the technological advances.
But now design objects of such a complexity that would be impossible for me to speak in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are thousands of millions.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we thought about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine, and the machine with that does something that you wouldn't do, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer computer, you can run a hundred million views of <unk>
You could run these instructions from instructions at random, just run all those programs, and take those who are going to become what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to measure numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely to some random of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers on the order right right.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that did the <unk>
Let's get out of those and <unk> the rest.
And now we will find the numbers that are best <unk>
And back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that we <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will get the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of computer programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
You can hear some mutations together.
And it tries to try again and do it with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or, in complicated cases in a few hours.
At the end of the end, we ended up with programs that were looking at an absolutely perfect way.
In fact, it's a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to do this to see how they work.
These are dark, strangers.
But they meet <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety that you get the goal because you come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
I once was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he's got a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than producing normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so can run these programs much more quickly.
You know, it is <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We're the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I get stuck.
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up a part of my <unk> <unk>
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the end, the World Wide World War.
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about getting <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics, and we used to form a great baseball team.
I'm focusing on one of them and I hope many of you have heard it.
It's called average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that we will have, 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball to the field of play without being <unk> and that anyone who's going to do to the first base, doesn't get to time, and the second basis will be <unk>
three <unk> <unk>
You know what you call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how you call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody who from 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League <unk> <unk> in run more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I'm going to take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you have a surgeon who has also a <unk> record.
That's not working, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place -- and a dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor will bring it to a cardiologist whose record record is 200 percent.
But do you know something?
She is getting really improving this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I ask:
What do you think it must be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a nurse or a nurse for a <unk> <unk>
1,000, great.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in medicine knows the hits.
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I included myself with the mandate to be perfect.
You never, ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I would argue when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> until a blood test.
Just like this.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> of nurses at the General Children's Hospital at Toronto, not far away from here.
And I learned all of memory.
Out of my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the muscle work <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnosis of frequent <unk>
And I even knew the wild diagnosis on how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much as we move more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the medical school to the impression that if you were going to do it, then you would know everything, or more possible to all of all, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when brought the lady to the emergency room where I worked.
At that time, I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when the emergency company requested to take a cardiologist to come to the patient.
And I informed the boss of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which was a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, and they're filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I would tell him.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate pressure in his heart.
I gave it <unk> of water, so that it could eliminate liquid it.
And within an hour or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt great.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
He sent him home without talking to the boss of residents.
I didn't get up the phone, and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it -- it would have been able to contribute information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
I may not want to be a resident being a constant attention.
I might want to be so successful and able to take away from my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they sent her home, he didn't take attention to a voice in my inside that said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it.
In fact, I was so glad that until I asked the nurse that I would join Mrs. <unk> "Do you believe that it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said with total <unk> "Yes, I think I'm going to be OK."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that he wrote the tall, and the ambulance next with the ambulance <unk> her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in your stomach.
But I kept following my job.
At the end of the day, you would get to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that time, I did something that I don't do normally, I did something that I don't do normally, I did something that I don't do normally, at the time.
I went through the emergency room service service.
And there another nurse, not that she <unk> from Mrs. <unk> before, but the other. He told me three words, those three words that most medical doctors.
Other specialists fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words is: Does it remember this?
"He remembers from the patient's <unk>
He asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and at the edge of death.
In an hour I had come to her house, after I gave her the tall, she suffered a collapse, and his family was called the <unk> and the ambulance <unk> brought them to the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a severe difference.
I was just breathing and blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all its resources.
They gave them medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the spinal cord.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and I expected all the hope that they would expect.
And in the two or three days it was clear that you never know.
He had permanent <unk>
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they would get to what was happening.
And by the ninth day, he left her to go. Mrs. wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the weeks after, I was excited about it and experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and I felt lonely, <unk> without feeling a healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The shame that I talk about is that it makes us feel very badly inside.
It tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would take the stuff and made sure that I didn't get it wrong.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> why he sent him home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I make a mistake so <unk>
Why did I chose medicine?
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day, she opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if you were going to get the efforts to be perfect for you to make more mistakes, I would make away from those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it was going to happen.
Two years later, it was an <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her throat, I was a little <unk>
He was <unk> penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door, he was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my head change my boss asked to talk to me in his office.
And he gave the three words: Does it remember this?
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but the upper eye, and that can cause the closing of those tracks.
He, wasn't dead.
You would take antibiotics for <unk> and you regained the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then <unk> and returned to work, until over and over again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a big endeavor, and especially working in a hospital, because they were going to be 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
You would have an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out, a colleague of mine I was checking to the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the bottom quadrant, and I called the surgeon <unk>
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I took it liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
I checked it down, and when you see some sensitivity in the bottom quadrant, I called the surgeon a surgeon.
They were both operated on and recovered well.
But every case I was <unk> I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get it, and talk about my errors, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how to share this with my <unk>
How do I teach you that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> my wrong leg -- trust that I would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> who make mistakes and not, which you can't sleep, and the ones that I know; you have <unk> results and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, as antibodies that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get in medicine to people who make mistakes, will be a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years about spread and journalism, I have made a personal personal study of bad medical litigation and failures to learn as possible, from the first article that I wrote to the Toronto, Star Toronto until my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors are happening every day, where one of 10 drugs will be messed up in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right -- in a system where bacterial infections are more and more <unk> to complete chaos and death.
In this country, they die in the country, 60,000 medical mistakes <unk>
The United States Institute set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so it's things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going to be divided every two or three years, and we don't care about it.
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to do a perfect history of a patient with pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- comes <unk> with eyes <unk> and with <unk> and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
For all of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we remove all the professional speakers to error, well, not to be nobody.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> Art <unk> is my worst <unk> I would tell everyone, from the ambulance to the head of surgery -- to the head of surgery -- this is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone toward them.
And their students would come down, and they would go down to the head and take saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical culture culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The foreign physician is human knows human, they know it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but he tries to learn what happened to teach others.
We would have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
We will make the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and for support for everyone to be saved.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes at time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm human. <unk> errors in mistakes.
And I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick a half a half American, are about 70 to a day.
Not a lot of a research followed over a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks by these executives and the time that we were going to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs.
Naturally, every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or over his time.
Now think of your choices.
You know how many you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How <unk> the way those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the overload of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
In other ways, when you do a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this deep level of a very, very <unk> level at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water, and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but at one occasion, I asked myself, why I never buy nothing?
This is a shelf on the oil oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked her to do well that this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He was telling me the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hallway.
They had different kinds of different classes.
He took a post for <unk> right to the tent.
We put out there with six <unk> or 24 tastes different and look at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a 60 percent, that when there were only six, about 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
What stopped when there was only three percent of us only three percent got to buy <unk>
When there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably will be <unk> less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices affects us in good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even when this doesn't get us?
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe you a study I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for about a million Americans from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in looking at if the number of funds that are available in savings plans for retirement, <unk> <unk> to people to save for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans to go from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the larger number of funds were <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that provide two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as she wanted to.
And in the plans that were offered to be offered the rate of participation at the <unk> 60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more options, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those of those who decided to participate, the number of choice, more people were being killed by avoiding actions or hedge funds.
As soon as there was more choices, they were more willing to invest in the market financial account.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that are <unk> to optimize the financial financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three major negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision, the <unk> even when this is against their self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions.
They are more likely to choose things less <unk> even though they objectively them better.
The main reason is that we were looking at that huge array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations so we can hope to compare and choose from that awesome <unk>
Today I want to take you through four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test them in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You heard about it before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than today, less than today, it's less than today.
People always care when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually, what we're seeing is that if you decide to cut, you get rid of <unk> choices -- strange <unk> there will be an increase in sales, you will have a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Rule was <unk> by eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that less <unk> became the <unk> in <unk> for two major <unk> more <unk>
You know, you know that living today, on average offer 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart shop about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the current world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce material.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard program.
All of the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a full fund of life.
The people who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are <unk> options.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> the differences that there's among those options.
And if their employees can't afford them, they can't do their <unk> either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he'd be willing to offer people in this audience a couple of paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want to give you a round of applause. If you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a fake.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first hand, that in the second thing, I can <unk> and say that they thought the second time was real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the overload of the overload of the overload of the delivery of the <unk>
For people to understand the differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences should be very <unk> very <unk>
Why is people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average, when it uses credit cards or credit cards when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were being trained to a <unk> plan.
At that meeting, it <unk> exactly how it <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that he gave the staff to the staff who would think of the positive things that they would <unk> in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a increase in 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories.
So for example, this is a study that we did in a newspaper factory.
What we saw was that in the retail <unk> along the <unk> the exhibition of magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds to <unk>
But, you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> will give you a <unk>
<unk> Well, there are a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> will give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This classification framework is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to you who are <unk> not when you get them.
You often see this problem with those huge fortune lists here.
People are supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think about -- if just <unk> a little bit.
We need to increase complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision, <unk> buying a car.
This is a German German vehicle maker.
You have to make 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offer each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
So what I'm going to do is vary the order to make the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from lots of options, 56 colors, just four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
What about you are.
If you break it up, always the default button on every decision, this indicates you are <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that are going from many choices to 30,000 people, the default button over and over and over again.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order of information as information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the pick box box doesn't say anything about the preferences of <unk> interior, in all ways made us to choose to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories.
All these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their business, or for people who are going to work.
Is it that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful by <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> in the East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter I had to write it to the government.
I had to register a piece of text text written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message, they could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much this is going to make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and prints a page, that page will end up having some yellow yellow dots on every page that follows a pattern that makes you and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can set the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are we the <unk>
As Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, very large amounts.
There are actually a lot of online online cases online, <unk> that would make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media with bank <unk> to steal the money from our accounts when we bought it in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought it on a <unk> computer.
The secret service of the United States two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> millions of dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> which is a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most criminal crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance today is not motivated by money.
There is another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them their opinions, they motivate them.
And groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do it for money, <unk> as Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group is the United States governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
Do you get the safety of the site and brought a <unk>
Last week, I said to a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government who asked one of the leaders if he asked one of the leaders if they said, <unk> death of people causing the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die of a heart attack.
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do they serve the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we <unk> a foreign <unk> authority.
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> <unk> headquarters for the Egyptian secret police in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And inside that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept a large scale of the communications in the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the government <unk>
The company base is right here.
I mean, Western governments will provide the tools to <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you are suspicious of a good case for a good case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It <unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these things that the obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do you sleep?
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's about privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we're going to do today, will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the south part of National Park.
These are the cows of my father at the bottom, and behind the cows, National Park.
The National Park National Park has no fences in the largest part of the south, which means wild animals like the <unk> <unk> out of the park.
And predators, like the lions go, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our cattle.
This is one of those who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it really bad because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and that's why we value it so much.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
People are dying of the warriors that protect our community and the cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's so few at the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought male lions give them afraid.
But I realized that this doesn't really <unk> because even helped lions see the pen <unk>
I don't have to tell you, <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick lions so that they believed that it was near the <unk>
But male lions are really smart.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they came back, and they said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So I just killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come back.
And I discovered the lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which to light and turn out the lights.
And this is a little <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery -- the electricity to the little <unk> <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> you get out there, because that's where lions.
And that's what lions look like when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> to lions so that I am walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses, you heard the idea.
One of them is about this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and asked them if he could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used for all Kenya, to scare other predators, like hyenas, <unk> and it's also being used for <unk> elephants in farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a child in the grasslands, of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and used to see airplanes and told me that some day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to become a aviation engineer and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving cows from my father and lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is to listen to a story like yours.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electric inventions today.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that it was already invented.
CA: You know, I heard it once, and I have tried it before, but I had tried it before, but I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot of the canyon. Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We're going to take you on every single step that I would give you a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
and I grew up singing with a song called "No <unk> <unk>
And I felt so proud.
In school, we moved all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned much of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea is the enemies.
Although I was asked about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my colleague of my sister.
And he said, "When I do this, the five members of the family will never exist in this world, because we haven't eaten at the two weeks at the past.
We're putting together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead, in the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms looking at her mother and she could do nothing.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about them and their families.
A huge famine took off North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and just few survived eating grass, insects, and tree.
They were also made more and more <unk> energy cuts all around me was completely dark at night except in the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is about North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North America to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river, right?
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of hunger, I was sent to China to live with family farmers.
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely hard, but dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to an awful fate back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested by the Chinese police and stood on the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and so many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer said to another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they left me. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China, and <unk> North Korea, where they are <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was fortunate to escape many other North Koreans haven't been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all the world can be <unk> at a second.
That's why after 10 years to hide my identity, I've decided to take it to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in Korea was a much greater challenge than expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call myself a pride of mine.
Even though I went to the life in Korea was not easy, made a plan. I started studying for the dawn of income to college.
Right when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities was a little bit of money that sent my family, and as my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location from the <unk>
They had to flee immediate away.
So I started planning on how to help them to escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China, and I went to the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese -- I had to stand up in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China, and then through southern Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
He asked for all of us, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came over to my family, <unk> I stood up and told me that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But at the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison cuts from the <unk> of South Korea.
I was going to go and come in between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asked me, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I gave him the situation, and without <unk> the man was to the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I was talking about it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told me.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when you get it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the aid of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea, and we met in South Korea.
But to achieve their freedom is only half the battle.
Many Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in the English language English, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family members, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Southern environments.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> food, fast <unk>
So the city planners came together and they thought, we're going to change the South Center so that it represents something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles as if this is going to be done in the city.
This is L.A.
Like it <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert, and Los Angeles Center to the South <unk> home of food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that places of food to get killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of communicable diseases.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times higher than, say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I wonder, how would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of your house, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see <unk> wheels and sold like <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I consider that the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
He also got tired of driving 45 minutes back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a course of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters by 45 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it up.
I said, "Well, I can do what it comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to keep it going.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we get together and we started to plant our food forest -- trees, <unk> you know, the nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of paid group for ahead of us made up by gardeners of all the <unk> all over the city, completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then someone gets <unk>
The city on top of me and in summary gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my backyard, the <unk> was made ordered <unk>
And I said, "Come on, do you?
An order for plant to plant food on a piece of land that nobody <unk>  Then I was like, "Well, let's look at it.
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition to <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, you go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk> terrain.
That's equivalent to 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million <unk>
Why on earth don't it look like this?
<unk> a plant will give you a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of outcome.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, growing your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Dakota.
I grew up there. I got my kids there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to actually manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I built my art.
So as an artist of <unk> that <unk> walls, I <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, as a piece of canvas, and plants and the plants are my <unk> of that canvas.
You get rid of what the earth can do, if you leave your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became an education tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You get rid of how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and thought that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> at night and they were in my garden, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that you were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for one reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people will steal your <unk>
What I say, "For God no, I am not afraid that you go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another time I put a garden on a shelter to <unk> at the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, they helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant with their mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed it, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like about 50 people who come and work and make all of them on a volunteer.
If kids cultivate <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If you cultivate <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if none of these things are <unk> if you don't teach them how the food affects your mind and your body, eat blind people in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they're stuck. I see color kids that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
I see the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are getting rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington, D.C.
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plan. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant all a block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into a healthy <unk>
I didn't tell me.
I'm not talking about free, because it's not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to bring people to the street, take the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you take them to take your <unk> OK?
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to get with me, well, if you want to see me, I don't call me if you want to sit in the wrong chairs, and have meetings to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very nice road at all.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive away, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go <unk> in your bike and these cars go on that it's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the Netherlands, you would want a silent road.
The solution for that is to make roads on asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the world's roads in the Netherlands, has <unk> and water can go through it, so all the water water flow down the sides and you will have a road that it's easy to drive up, and we don't get water to be never more.
The noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear -- so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You can see that on this highway stones on the surface of the surface.
First, a stone, then more and more and more, and so on, and I don't do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> He's done.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how damage is in this material.
It's a <unk> <unk> as I said, so it only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> of light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> are <unk> and if you are <unk> you will be <unk> and you will separate from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials of <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we will probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we can use steel fleece from that to clean up, and we can cut off <unk> and steel <unk> and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel knitting in it.
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat up the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the rocks will spread back to the surface.
Today I was using a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine to <unk> here onstage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the show that now I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
And I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried many samples out there and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave up a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> in which we had to do a test test to test this material.
So that was what we did there, you see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road lasts for several years without damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and the atom then with our <unk> machine, and we pull them down, and we put them back.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using steel, bringing these fibers together using the power of steel, bringing these fibers, using <unk> energy to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even you can double the life of the surface. It actually will save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious about if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how repairability does.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's watch. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to me in his little gray radio.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual at the time, because the news is usually going to do it.
"The Taliban <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> in Afghanistan and they made girls go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a kid to <unk> my oldest sister -- who couldn't be alone to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two we could <unk>
Every day, we were taking a different route so that no one could suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide the books on the market bag so that we were going shopping out.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us buried in a small room.
It was nice in the winter but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we would hold our lives, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, the school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Pakistani Taliban
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters was <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. Afghanistan in which his daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my mother educated became teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to turn our home home to girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their kids had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk in not to educate your children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated about our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can keep your house during a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you still want to do it <unk>
I am 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than high school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the <unk> who was <unk> from his home to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't just get rid of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it driving on the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why they <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, as the mine, <unk> for them, despite them, despite them, even though they are in front of a surgical opposition.
Like <unk> it's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter would go from <unk> to his village, and literally escaped being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to her house, it is the telephone, a voice would pick him out that if I kept sending her daughter to school, I'll try.
<unk> now, if you <unk> he said, "I don't harm the future of my daughter for your old and <unk> ideas."
What I realize about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, which is behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees her success his own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers are not key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like about Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school is to tell in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
It turns out that these changes didn't last a lot, after the retirement of the United States.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and her parents who would <unk> for them, that the <unk> see a future <unk> and a domestic change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> I gave it to me.
Like me dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never have a revolutionary <unk>
They've been almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the massive <unk> of <unk> both of the <unk> revolution.
A forces with a lot of other citizens who are driving inside and out of the country to call one day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men and young men -- they were in the summer where they are carrying billboards and <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> bravery in the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and about 1,000 losses from about 50 billion, we managed to release our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy burden of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I have dear, along with many other women, rebuilding civil civil society <unk> a <unk> transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation to democracy and national reconciliation to democracy and national reconciliation to democracy and national reconciliation to democracy and national reconciliation to democracy and national reconciliation to democracy and national reconciliation to democracy and national reconciliation to democracy and national
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> roughly 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started to organize workshops about the development of capacity, and skills of leadership.
With an amazing group of women we started <unk> women <unk> <unk> for <unk> a movement of women, leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right of participation in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was getting more and more <unk> than <unk> the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was meant and successful.
Women won an <unk> of the National Congress in the first choices for 52 years.
However, very little to little, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we were all the news news.
One day we wake up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American Ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we wake up with the news of the murder of murder officers of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and his <unk> human rights rapes in the prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made a revolutionary mentality more, and it has become away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the revolution.
I'm not here today, at all of us at <unk> with our history of success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we are choosing to make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because election didn't bring peace and stability and security.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and so much for men as for women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the feminine values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation creation more than it needed the elections, which only <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the female the most of the most of the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage, and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female discourse that not only <unk> but also to put it to practice <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration instead of the competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, desperately desperately needs to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about interrelationship and <unk> between female <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran -- <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions of the same root as the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that involves all of the humanity that men and women, of which all tribes and all people have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus, completely covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion for all of existence.
So this is what it is, "My <unk> is going on all the things."
So this is what she said, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
It will all give you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a top-down question, which has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to do is that they all make a good guy, why she is left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I had been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man who I was creating my soul <unk> I would lie to the head with a <unk> with bullets from <unk>
The man, which I loved one in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where falling every year of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies of the list -- <unk> between them and Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington, <unk>
I have almost 20 years married to my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can go to anyone, all the race, all of the religion, all of the health levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that all of you think that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse is only men, and the <unk> violence is just going on in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> meaning by which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going on with a man who did it and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and over 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also got a typical victim, because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and November night of January.
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York and started to <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just graduated from a university of <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me was that the first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a kid in the field.
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things he made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partner.
He did it all over the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me that I was ready, that I had gone to Harvard who would put a passion on helping teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood and my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer, and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was why I went back to that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner -- so I left my job and <unk> and I went out of Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering a head in a physical <unk> financial and carefully carefully <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it is.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place is supposed to feel so safe was bought by three <unk>
One had on the <unk> of the car.
Another <unk> kept it under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma that they lived small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never raised my hand, my life was already <unk> danger, every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> was five days before our wedding.
It was seven o'clock in the morning and still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I got the girlfriend of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened. I was sure that we lived happy forever, because I was loved and he loved it, and he wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a very good sense of the wedding and for the fact of making a family with me.
It was a isolated accident, and I never would hurt me.
I spent twice as much as our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that we would spend several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back on our moon of honey. He stood up by the traffic and threw me a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was scared when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One in three Americans is a domestic and harassing violence in some time of his life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man who was the only person in the world that he could help <unk> to deal with their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is why they simply don't <unk>
Why did I not tell me, I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we are the victims, we know something that you normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of violence in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has finally put to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent disorders, even after the <unk> has gone to marry, and <unk> of financial resources, and the engineering system of the family justice system to protect the victim and their children, who are usually obliged for judges to spend time not with the man who survived their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's just not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> <unk> that beat my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if he would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the entire world: I told my neighbors and my friends and family, all strangers, and I'm here today because all of you would tell me.
We have the trend to <unk> victims like <unk> women -- women <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say "The fault is it by <unk> as if the victims were trying to <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also <unk> that they learned a lot of the stories of what happened and who would take their lives joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor.
I came to marry a man and cute and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What you won't get to have ever more, ever, is a <unk> pistol with my head in the hands of someone who says she wants.
At this point, you are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they were <unk> they are <unk> themselves.
The abuse could be affecting his daughter, her sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy silent love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of light talking about it with their children, their coworkers and family.
You know, your vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims that are safe.
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis of certain and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for about 10 years.
And I feel that at this moment there is a <unk> tension in the room because I shouldn't have seemed like this.  I'm lucky, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to go on, but they will find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These graduates are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through this sweater through your head, because it's when you go to laughing from me, so I don't do anything while I covers my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, it had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I would hold my back, and I would get the hair on the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan as I did two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our appearance, which, as superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model of it.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you become model?
And I always say, a <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're asking what this is?
Well, in the last centuries, we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> also we've been associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that is my heritage heritage, that I've known to use to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who now show <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> the fashion that <unk> Stop. Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the ones for knowing so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told all of and every single role of models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people are always asking me is to be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know that.
But then what I would tell you about every one of these girls is: Why?
You can be president of the United States, or the next Internet, or a <unk> surgeon or a poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If after this kind of crease list, I still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> chief of American magazine or <unk> executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say you most want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you be higher.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a work that you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate all I learned in 10 years as a model, which, unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you already have your studies, and you have a resume and a few jobs and a little bit of your back, no matter what you think is, I mean, if you want to be president of the United States, but you have to find them out of indoor clothes for 10 years, people would look at you weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all of the pictures are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a child.
So it looked along with my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my soccer equipment and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a group of professional professionals, <unk> <unk> and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> people and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always doing is to do for free?
I have too many inches from 20 inches and that I never use, except the before, but the privilege that I get are the ones I get in the real life, and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to wear money, and they gave me for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> she jumped on red light and of course, we were <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to be able to follow <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for my way, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for what they look like.
I live in New York, and last year, of the teenage girls who stood up and 86 percent were black and Latino people, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino people in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
I think of how many times I was <unk> and <unk>
And when we investigate this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes down to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people do is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you've got the bright hair and you will feel so happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give you an answer that maybe you can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible can work with creative and ingenious and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about what every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with a little bit thinner legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They just have to get together with a group of models, because they have the most expensive legs and the most brilliant hair and clothes -- but probably even the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to look at a situation of racial and gender oppression when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to hold out of this talk, I hope that everyone will feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image in the perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
photography has been my passion since I was most enough enough to hold up a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 little pictures more <unk> and I didn't have been me <unk>
There was no CFO, no <unk> no chance to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum amount of <unk>
In fact, most of them took random tourists random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took this picture holding my daughter on his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and five.
He had happened that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to New York City on a <unk> journey, you continue to <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that they would take us to get out of the photo.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever met the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much it would change this journey to us.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day was that a five-year-old would be understood.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way to stop time at a week in October and to make us think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we were always taking the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you see and interact with everything.
That particular time we spent together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the trips -- we were walking, when all of a sudden, she stopped in the dry and signal a red <unk> of the pirate supply store, which <unk> <unk>
And it described to me what there was a sense about five years standing in that same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of being actively in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many family pictures.
I'm always going to get the photo out of it.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I didn't want to come up with somebody and ask him, and he gets us a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are in the most primitive <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter, <unk> as stupid stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press to make the press and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept.
I don't accept. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not keeping clean the environment --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of diseases.
<unk> are <unk>    They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> in the New World who are mostly located in <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the West -- where we have 16 species. From these 16, 11 are facing a high risk of extinction.
So why are you <unk> they are important, first of all, provide vital ecological services, <unk>
They're our natural <unk>
They took the bodies to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax -- that not be for them would stretch and cause large losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times longer in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
The <unk> also have huge importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
It was the symbol of the milk and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto and under Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they make a lot of important <unk> to open sky in places like Tibet -- there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so that these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are on the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In the south of Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critically endangered list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall out of <unk> consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use veterinarian in India and have taken a posture.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge time bomb to <unk> The number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be top of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade trade of death to serve <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so to focus on a general problem is not going to serve at all.
We need to work with governments on the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to look at these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? You can become active to make noise. You can write a letter to your government, and you can tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures that are going to spread the word.
When you go out of this room, you would tell you about <unk> but talk to your families, with their children, with their neighbors about <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed from opinion because he saw it with no effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do -- and all I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
I went to 21, which we Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, all of the things that I would <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people of Zambia to grow food.
So we got with <unk> <unk> to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the <unk> River and taught the local tomatoes and Italians and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they don't <unk>  We were rather than the local in so <unk> valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we did not know -- you know, God we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow this size in Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy it is.
When tomatoes were beautiful and <unk> in the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared in the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought only of us would know that we were <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans were doing, what they were doing in the English and then to see what they were doing, and I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least feed the <unk>
<unk> will look at the <unk> --  <unk> see the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people of Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about damage that the money has <unk>
Just read their book.
It's part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat anybody in a different culture as if you were my kids. I want you too long.
<unk> I treat all of a different culture as if you were <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "It was a little <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be able to be <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor, and he said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided for the 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never go to anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people, who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what does you? Is it <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you feel with the people of the <unk>
We don't work in the office.
We brought together in a coffee. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, for once, but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have been identified.
So, planning has this point blind.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business, who sets up with you in your house, at the coffee table -- and that helps her to find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this condescending junk that we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects on the march, and the government came to see me to ask, "How can you do that?
And I said, "I did a very, very difficult thing.
I was <unk> and ...  So --  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped it start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> of history, passed away a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they were involved in business, and this is what Peter says Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now we are <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what most people <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you.
You have to offer you to privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then they will come up with mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show you more about this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the spirit spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossils of fossil revolution, <unk> -- and at one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> it's not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There aren't the technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the <unk> year, this group of people gathered together -- and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> -- six million horses. and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed up <unk> manufacturers companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories -- <unk> factories in places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk to you.
Then you have to give you an absolute absolute <unk> service.
And later you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the largest company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to talk with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell you with a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and search for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've tested and watched the 100 companies icons of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all new companies Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful success companies in the world have in common, only one was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when she began.
Nobody starts a company alone.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of small business <unk> in bars with their dedicated masonry <unk> who will do for you, what someone did by this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who talks to you, what would need it?
What can you do? Can you do it?
OK, you can <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
<unk> can help us in a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change a lot of knowledge despite the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to <unk>
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understanding our <unk>
How do you share our hopes to the empty stores so that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives the music to the music --  there is a show in New York City --  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most beautiful American properties.
I live near this house, and I thought how could turn it into a kind of a nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and so much.
And this occurred to me a deep gratitude for the time and all of the time.
It gave the clarity of my current life.
But <unk> for keeping this look in my daily life.
I think it's easy to be able to catch up by day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house, left on a giant board and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before I die of dying <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> to reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before I die of dying I want to be <unk>   "Before I die of dying I want to sit on the line of <unk>
"Before I die of dying I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die of dying I want to plant a <unk>
"Before I die of dying I want to live outside the <unk>
"Before I die of dying I want to spend it once more."
"Before I die of dying I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
"Before I die of dying I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space and the dreams and the dreams of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's trying to understand our neighbors in new ways and new ways -- it's about giving the reflection and <unk> and remembering what's most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the West <unk> we did a kit and now have been made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of violent distractions is more important than ever, to find ways of preserving perspective and remembering that life is brief and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even I understood that we will prepare for death is one of those things that will become more power.
Think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, and as a community and more means to share hope, and the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 and very hot.
We don't speak, but it carries a better joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> pass on what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and notice about this: Never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to say words that I could not even get <unk> reminds me of one thing, how much we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
Do you learn the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that every songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what it propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though you wouldn't consider it, it could only mean one thing, that they were <unk> <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, by learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In every individual is embedded in a different form of a different way, and that's so different to Sam.
And throughout the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause no cure cure in the world.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years when my brother came into the world, and I was very excited about having a new being in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
It was alive and <unk> in his own world, with its own rules, and I found pleasure in the small things, like putting cars around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that there was <unk>
As I was growing up, it gets more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the frustration and <unk> -- there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature -- a child who looked at the world without <unk> a human being that there was never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were right like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and love, and love, and I realize that these are things that I would not want to change by normal.
<unk> happens by high the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and all of you, you know, you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences you <unk> It's a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inside and honestly, the pursuit of <unk> is the ultimate sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for the <unk> progress and the change dies at the moment that we're trying to be like each other.
Please please say I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what should have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me, a communications, of communications, giving a computer class to students of engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> really <unk> from these students with his big minds and his big books and their great words and the unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> should have felt like it fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
And so I felt when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and the health care of our health, and if we don't know about this, work is not in fact, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have this interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers aren't invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that they study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when they're describing your science, <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make them silly as well.
Instead, as Einstein said, it's all as easy as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly your science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- these are ways of calculating and <unk> with their content.
And when you present your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk>
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it supports too much in the language area of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the audience can understand if it loses a little bit, and then provide graphs that will fill our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they are <unk>
I think these are just some key in which you can help the rest of the door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists, and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century that the defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge or <unk> and that, when he won, he gets it on the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they need to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
They put him on the London Tower and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London to won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how the words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the United States right after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, its leader.
You didn't know that.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They introduced all kinds of suggestions that they could have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with it were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King by a given term.
And there could be <unk>
The whole world got tired and <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
And I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and I was always going to have this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be ashamed of power.
They didn't want to call it King by if he did not get him to her to get it to his field."
So they wanted to give it the most <unk> title more <unk> and more unfortunate that they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> title.
And so the Senate was <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign and <unk> with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take it seriously.
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't know.
We can learn three interesting things all about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite -- until I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measurement is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk> more years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important, and with this is that the title of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear weapons, the world's biggest economy and <unk> air fleet and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, looked like, well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so forth.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because nobody is going to be going to feel humble when you tell you that it's now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do with you to <unk>
Politicians try and use the words to shape and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually changes it much more than the words than they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under the land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is heavy from heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak about, but mostly that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and stones and <unk> with primitive tools.
Like others, I have a cheap <unk> of light <unk> tied to head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a subway that falls hundreds of meters on the ground.
He <unk> my hand, and suddenly I remember a mining that I met days before, who lost over the control and fell at <unk> meters in that toilet.
As I talk to you today, these guys are at the deep end of that hole at risking their lives without paying a reward and often, and often, dying.
I went out of that hole and went home, but they may never do it because they are prey of slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in over 70 countries in the past of 70 countries in 2009, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> at the Summit of Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGOs which is dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and actually, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was existed in the world, but not as a degree.
When we end up talking to me that I was very sad, honestly I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I got choked up the stomach and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So it started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, it had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced throughout the entire slave <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual wage of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about <unk>
However, you can enslaving entire families for generations per generations per <unk> dollars per <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from over 8,000 dollars a year worldwide.
Many have been <unk> with false education promises and better work to find out that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the <unk> goods produced <unk> but those who produce those are disposable ones.
The slavery exists all over the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the cottonseed <unk>
This strange, weird show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
It was <unk> at a temperature of 54 C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- they were going into a heavy <unk> <unk> categories.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee to eat, or to drink, and the severe <unk> did I pee out pretty <unk>
So <unk> was the heat and the dust that my camera got too hot to touch and left it.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the equipment and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me so clearly to show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
You couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not <unk>
I could put them into a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for his release, and he complained that he would get it.
And in terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas that I found kids <unk> stones for miles through <unk> terrain until they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who could charge them, and the kids would put them into their heads with straps made out of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16  17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers were freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this world consciousness was advised me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> women were <unk> women who had been previously previously <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> that gave this dirty basement of faint light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it is called the craft, they are local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, and private rooms, where they <unk> them with their girls and children, some of them only seven years -- are forced to <unk> and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of the <unk> and <unk> identified by a number of painted on the wall, and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
From my foot in <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I only had a <unk> the stairs where I <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no windows enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because they touch a very difficult issue, it is important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, are happening around us.
There are hundreds of people who are stuck in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can go on.
So recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as the sex slaves.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that often interact with the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families who had extended families in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of mine.
<unk> black hands are the father, the blue <unk> of blue and red of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these great barrels and we dive silk into the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
You still wait, however, can come out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to look at quickly.
I saw what it looked like to be a fishermen of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers, some younger children, a lot of young kids.
<unk> were all slaves.
The kids are separated from their families who are <unk> and forced to work with lots of these boats on the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This kid is eight years old.
When our boat came to come up with me -- that his small canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of trees in the <unk> lake in Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, and with fear, it's got to the water to unlock the branches.
Many <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it tries to the youngest slaves under his command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when we were going to go through the last networks, but they had been working on the past one.
On the cold winter night.
And you would point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi <unk>
Who will be because of someone who decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
It asked us to do it for a land road to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we were getting out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
And then pointed out this path barely visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started down, we took away the <unk> that we would go on the road and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as I went to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the path ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
Many women had children tied up to their backs, and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in icy water.
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are embedded in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to be 90 feet and these people carry these people with heavy stone bags that will then be transported to another area where they would bring the gold to extract the gold.
To the first sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer, we see a lot less and the margin are going to work with some more children.
All of them are victims of creating diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of T.B. and the <unk> for mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle took him to work with him in the mines.
When he died his uncle, I was able to inherit the debt of the uncle what force it to be a slave in mines.
When I met her, I was working on the 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so severe that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
And yet, he dream about being released and <unk> with help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of an remote, which is inspired by a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will be testimony to them and that we're going to make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves as human beings, then it makes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think about these beautiful beautiful people, which I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force where you see it, in people like you, and I hope that that force turns a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do collaborative mathematics, and there's a peculiar problem for whom we are like the management Association.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We gave us the <unk> of ballet <unk> and the dancers.
But the demand for a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill, and probably some initial <unk> that you can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, naturally <unk> this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time was a ballet dancer dancer from ballet dance.
In the last few years has been made so much about treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need the tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know whether there is a cure will be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's a thing that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement have not been <unk> That's why we don't have the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk> of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of the clinical trials, they never do. It's never done.
How about patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test they were <unk>
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinic <unk>
So what I want to do with you as a really conventional way for a try, you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of <unk>
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds like a <unk> and we can imagine as a dancers of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that we need to do -- we need the <unk> for example.
And as they did it, it requires an extraordinary level.
Let's think about time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as they <unk> and as the Parkinson's will affect the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of the <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical trials -- Well, they're both <unk>
<unk> is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole set of hospitals to do it.
They're both <unk> OK, but the exams based on voice are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
It's low cost, and we all know what happens to us.
When something becomes so <unk> it appears on mass scale.
These are some incredible goals to address it.
We can reduce the patient's <unk>
It won't do a need to go to the clinic for the follow-up <unk>
We have high <unk> we could get goals out.
We could make a massive <unk> mass for clinical trials for the first time, <unk> <unk> at the end scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So when you give the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Global <unk> Initiative.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have accessible local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> or without disease, can be called at the price and letting recordings for some cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.
What would you bring from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to tell you if you have or not the disease. Sure.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in the different <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion to search of real markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have a <unk> accuracy at this point?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic work and now has been demonstrated that it works in the mobile phone network too, which we <unk> the project. We have 99 percent precision.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's <unk>
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are alien <unk> creatures.
We were <unk> in the dark, in rooms without windows and usually we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models still more <unk> the perfect skin still <unk> we are able to do the impossible and spread out in the press all the time -- but some of us are really artists with talent with a lot of the experience and a real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, as well as the rest of the world, the events that were happening in Japan.
So a long time later, an organization where I was voluntary -- <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May traveled to <unk>
It's a small <unk> <unk> located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people -- one of the first people affected by the wave.
The water level of water recorded over 24 meters and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools took the slime schools and leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> of pictures and cameras and punch cards.
Everyone did the same.
<unk> and take them to different places of villages around to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely all they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped to clean up the bathrooms -- the enormous huge <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the middle of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor for that day to hold up in me for the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard of expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until far beyond my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years ago, some still were in the lab about the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we needed to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to do it with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
With the step of time, they came for kind of more pictures and it was needed more <unk> so I went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> a town to the north of <unk>
Once to the week we use our scanner in the early academic libraries that had been <unk> where people would reclaim their photos.
And the time you go to <unk> it's a different story, depended on of the <unk> of the photos.
It could be <unk> it could be a few weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw on a hand on hand using a guide to the areas whose color and detail and the water was not destroyed.
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures that were floating on water covered with algae, and even with oil, all of that together with the time of time I continue to <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have the guide to a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk> pictures.
As I said once once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't do mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her, but she stopped realizing that they would get them even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been <unk> we could put the images on a single picture and they took a picture of the whole picture.
When I collected his pictures shared some of his history with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble of the rubble that he used to be their house, but their colleagues would tell him.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Your small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took him a week to find his entire family and know that they had survived.
The day I gave her his pictures his youngest son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that I could <unk> something that could remind you of the past that had not been marked by that summer day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- hundreds of them helped us clean together over <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority went back to the hands of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us give back to 90 families hundreds of all of a whole <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of the ink to <unk>
We took pictures.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, somebody wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would give us but the first thing to look for.
Now, this was the project of restore small pieces of humanity, to give someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this will give somebody a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to them with something bigger, to give back, using their talent for something that they're not familiar with perfect skin.
So I would like to read this email and I sent it back the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While I was <unk> I couldn't stop thinking of people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, me and my youngest daughter hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs, right?
Thank you.  Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an exhibition in an exhibition of just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique so fast that you can create videos in slow motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see inside of the body without using X-rays, and we really challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointing and I switch it down, and you switch it into a <unk> or it is, in a number of <unk> you can create a <unk> package of just one millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a bullet has a common <unk>
If we took that bullet and this <unk> package and <unk> it in this bottle, how do those photons disperse into this <unk>
What is the thing about light <unk>
Now, this whole thing --  --  remember that all happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light on movement.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a <unk> package that starts <unk> and that inside, it starts <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces off the inside.
At that time, the waves travel through the table and because of the thoughts of the top part you see in the bottom of the bottle, after a variety of boxes, that the thoughts were <unk>
Now, if we take a bullet and current and we make it run the same distance and we see it in slow chamber about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
A day?
It would be a very boring film --  of a slow <unk>
And what about the nature of <unk>
You can see the waves of the table, the tomato and the background wall.
It's like throwing a rock into a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at one time more than this, you'll realize that, as light gets rid of the tomato <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and light bounces on its interior and it goes back after several <unk> <unk>
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, you will be able to go to the supermarket and check if fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture of a <unk> <unk> it enters very little light.
But we go to a billion times faster than the shortest display, so you can barely enter some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and <unk> them to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw data and make them interesting.
<unk> can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, themselves.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would be allowed to see behind the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light from light on the door. You walk into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, right?
We could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We've already built.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the post of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons go back to the chamber but interestingly, in slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capability.
It's got very good resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what about the point it corresponds to the distance.
When you project a laser can record a photo <unk> which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like that, tens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> collisions with what's on the curve on the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected through the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> capable of seeing the inside of the body by having through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood of this is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new form of visualization to solve the problems of competing with the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he became the science of art, an art of photographs in <unk>
I realized that all the data data that we collected is not just for scientific visualizations but we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to know it.
We create a new form of computational photography with slow motion, and color codes.
And look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is only about <unk>
But here's a funny thing as well.
So if you look at the waves under the <unk> these are leaving us.
<unk> should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects, I would have loved this image.
The order of the events in the world are sometimes going on to the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can <unk> life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a cell phone can be <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, and you can get it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of thousands of people are going to find out for change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who's a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your phone, <unk>
<unk> A Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everyone today.
But today I'm going to talk about my cell phone, and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 different lines of information.
Data data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission on the E.U. presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every European phone company, every single Internet provider of all Europa, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls who. Who sends email to who.
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at at least six months, and until two years, in your phone company or his Internet <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone providers and the Internet providers, we have all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who went out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please give me all the information that they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to wonder, and I didn't get a particular answer, it was all blah blah blah blah.
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are holding my life.
So I decided to <unk> a court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end, they <unk> a agreement.
They would take the demand and they would send me the information that I would <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand dollars and five thousand dollars of information.
I first watched and said, well, it's a huge archive right.
But after a time I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life on this file.
Was it a little <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what data retention means.
So along with <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and down, go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to call it on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call each other, and the other one another, and you end up with this big communication network.
You can see how people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who send an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was sitting in this protest, and if you had it, I had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Coast would never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the government agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as it can be possible inside and outside.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not quite a <unk>
When you go home, you get to your representative that just because business agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information store of you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phones that you take to remember that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello teachers, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello teachers, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different different different directions -- to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so I have cerebral <unk>
<unk>
Is it <unk> I'm like a mix of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C is not genetics.
It's not <unk> and it can't be <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus, of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, brothers, though they are.
It just happens by accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of you to have any of us today.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you've wanted to be disabled.
Let's go walk.
Christmas <unk> they're at the shopping mall, drive in circles looking for parking lot and what do you see?
16 places for disabled.
And think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a gold <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, a woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Jurassic <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same <unk>
I also love that if I want to walk from my home to New York, you will.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the excuses.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I was <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents went to the school system, and they were <unk> that I was also outside, and if we didn't take all the top note -- all the top of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang up a dollar in front of me so that I did it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a psychopath <unk> that has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they continue to be all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a slogan of campaign.
The people I grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot of hunger during the <unk>
I would tell you that it had enough fat to live three months without eating a whole few months without eating the dawn on sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I was sent to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or, I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were wearing <unk> I would too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were stuck in <unk>
On the summer of summer often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> put me down hot cups on the back, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water, and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I should say that it's very boring, but before we do yoga it was an comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can <unk> on my head.
My parents would argue, this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the <unk> University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> pet in the theater department.
You know, all of me <unk>
I did all the least smart, I got on the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene of the crystal colony my faculty <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> in order to have a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of the end, we finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I'm a <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the director of the theater department, crying historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, why she said to me why and she told me that she could not do the kinds of risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts stunts -- neither can be <unk>
It was a role for that was literally born and gave an actress without cerebral <unk>
The college was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors with disabled.
And I went home, and my first tour, and my first tour, was just like extra in a <unk>
My dream was true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the directors of storytelling, not <unk> non-state actors, not white, with disability.
Just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
On my first tour, it took famous photography from New York to New Jersey to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first note that he took when she reached high speed on the <unk> of New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs in the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, no malnutrition and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and then to remind you the directors of proving that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to the Arab was much easier to fight the challenge of stigma for disability.
My great chance came in 2010.
I was a kind of invited to the news program for cable has <unk> Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduate dance, I went back to a study and sat me in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clinging to the speaker desk for not getting out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew I'm not going to have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was going on as a full-time participant and pasted my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
And it says that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me or a little girl not old.
All of a sudden, my Internet disability became <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What disease does it?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone else in the wheels can't do <unk> then <unk> can't make someone on the wheelchair.
<unk> are -- yeah, <unk> man.
The disabilities are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
Doctors said that I don't know -- but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with media, I don't think we were <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that's less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was a depiction of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> -- a charity organization to give Syrian refugee kids, to Palestinian kids, and I would find a lot of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me watching live, and I do this talk to her memory.
<unk> in <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know your story.
He lives in a small town of <unk>
This town is near <unk>
<unk> drives the small people to poverty and on the edge of <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there's no opportunities -- no job, no work in the future.
He ends up living in a tent in the city to the outskirts of <unk>
After maybe a year we were <unk> anything.
One day you give him a guy who offers him to take it to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
She meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send them home, their family.
They present it to a young lady.
Finally house.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
One beautiful day in <unk> under an blue sky, bursts a bomb car.
That little boy of that little village with dreams of the big city with the dreams of the big city was the <unk> <unk> and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> which was a connected terrorist organization to al Qaeda.
So how the story of a small town of a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends up with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start your future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came.
This was the first thing that took him out of what we call "the period of <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban people who <unk> riot at <unk> <unk> riot in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, but the young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffers from high rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities for the <unk> history of <unk> the door to terrorism, to violence -- to be the story of 2.0 cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
Seventy percent don't work, not to school.
They do pretty much anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the Hospital at <unk> the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> thinking, and if I never had it.
And if I had seen me forced myself to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was at <unk> that month was actually to harbor a few juvenile leaders at an enterprise.
We were going to go down to about 90 wounded leaders.
We sat down and we had a rainwater from ideas to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, because I was a graduate college -- frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different way.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> motorbikes to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of bikes for the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do differently?
I think your ability to identify and take a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
We will encourage young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking at so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of corporate progress.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic from plastic from abroad.
If you give somebody to somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those of you who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
A company of <unk> design <unk>
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And the delivery of flowers for wedding doctors, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working on the creation of the first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and like he says, smell of pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
They encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people to create a culture of social spirit is really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to <unk> in development and put in their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create a real way for urban growth.
For me, the spirit spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Its <unk> <unk> that's how it calls it when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired me from the street to help rent and keep the bikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape paralysis of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to become the young people in entrepreneurs, and they eat their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> an area in upstate New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was made that the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be the path that we <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful <unk> lake.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with Apple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought was going to clean up his <unk>
And that question went on with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how it <unk> or where you go to the <unk> who clean our crap in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris, or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash -- for 11 tons of waste and <unk> and two tons of products -- every day.
I wanted to know you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What does it feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their routes and I interviewed people in offices and facilities in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more.
So I started to work as <unk> of garbage.
Now I don't just travel in the trucks. I would have them.
And operated the mechanical <unk> and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong you will become quickly <unk>
It costs a lot used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies continue to get their bodies to get on their body tons of garbage every single weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the waste waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and pass on around you.
You just want to figure out, so the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the <unk>
And the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall on the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the stick of garbage.
When you leave the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It must always be movement.
And there's also the stigma.
I think that stigma is particularly ironic because I think the <unk> of waste are the most important hand of the city streets for three reasons.
They're the first protective of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the form of efficient and effective and effective every day, this starts to take away from their containers and their dangers inherent inherent in very real forms.
Heart that we had controlled for decades and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs the economy.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have room for what the engines of the economy start to fail when it's based on the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point out your relationship.
And then it's what I call our everyday average speed necessary.
So I mean just at the speed of which they used to move in the contemporary time.
We do not have any <unk> we don't have any <unk> and we took away with us our coffee cup -- our stock bag of the water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that it will take about it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about waste harvesting that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, in the street every day.
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us away from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
On one day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste harvesting on the street, I took my little son, and I went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be OK."
Shortly after that I started to investigate the waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together many times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include the costs of all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
The city waste that we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic of <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next you see someone whose work is to clean up the garbage of you, you know, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection to thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects today as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
In addition to the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, my team and me about what we needed to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out there?
After looking at some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores that people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat in the interior, so it's necessary for a lot of <unk>
In a city that this should not happen because it's a remote climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees per year.
And thirdly, what it looks like has nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's worth whether in a place as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this <unk> air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using foreign space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the survey of the site, which is located in a much area of the city growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we see in the image, don't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in a whole hundred meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, uniting all the inputs of the building.
And this spreads out of an <unk> <unk> which creates a space in the open air in the building that goes into its own shape, of the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small business, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that was going to fit the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric to a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air input and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside of the building.
And this is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
So with these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial mall, and it wasn't what they have."
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the mall because the end of the mall had more local to sell it.
And the idea of the facade was a lot more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where the electricity is cut down almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting <unk> on the ceiling.
And then under those panels we think of the ceiling as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which is collecting water for inner <unk>
It's expected for the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction floor.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest thing I ever have, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention on the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a <unk> wall of access that was connected by lower lines.
When I went to the place, the first campaign that we did was expand the streets and existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks like the size and the features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we pick some strategic points in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation be for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So I <unk> a framework that makes sure that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the plant we have all the connections to pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a greater density at higher levels and lower density in the plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving away the community to the space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and take them up and make activities like run a <unk> race for the morning, or jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same pace that the buildings grow in.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and that they have to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had a very bright loads of hair and a little <unk> and a cute little <unk> was very strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year, and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed at a time after the school <unk> I was a little afternoon and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took away from my teacher <unk>
And then, I did.
I would have the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some of those.
All of the things --  And I organized my book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other classmates, had really good notes too.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I went to all rows of <unk> and myself a row of the way, just because of being there, since I was going on.
I'm still amazed what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came about.
I don't understand why I was feeling well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never tell me.
It's that it was all obvious <unk>
I never got stuck.
But most of all, I was telling me, the reason why I was told that this little little girl would be so small, so <unk>
I was <unk> the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
The birds are also very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab in which we are looking at them in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> I would have had the literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
No king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
I wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I read the lists of reading from high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
There is no <unk> I know that it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and, as soon as you get them all the way that you have all of them.
This year they have been 100 years of their work <unk> "In the most mundane study of the sexual <unk> and also by the ordinary <unk> of mine, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot about how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as tough as <unk>
I don't know what the <unk> <unk> is, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the jealousy, that are reduced to the person, to their wish, to their <unk> they're a narrative <unk> base.
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being in <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details were going to look like to <unk> the <unk> right?
The <unk> do all of them all over <unk> and that's something that I understood understand.
All that she does to give me pleasure could be pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every charm charm that <unk> senses in his lover -- it adds up to his collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to leave the country, if you wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job, right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And what are the <unk>
The <unk> gets rid of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the big numbers of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> ties well the language of <unk> with jealousy.
When <unk> is in your agony of jealousy, soon listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not unlike your interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's really scientific research with true <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> look <unk> and they do seem <unk> but they do seem <unk> but in its <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for truth, a really painful truth -- in fact, to <unk> -- the more painful truth, the better the truth.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs us -- that makes us a range of feelings that makes us a much deeper sense of feelings and vital that a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No, I think it's trying to say that the <unk> will reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other emotion that teaches us to look at such a <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young man who was being consumed with the idea that his wife was going to do it.
And Freud says that there was something strange in that man, who didn't get stuck in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing this? behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or was accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
<unk> describe very well how <unk> do you to look at intensity but no accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we actually become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> lead us to do violent or illegal acts for it.
<unk> drives us to behave completely <unk>
Now I'm thinking about me for the eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about the news.
A woman from Michigan of 52 years of age was just captured by having created a false account on Facebook since they would send you messages to itself, for a year.
For one year.
She was trying to <unk> the new bride of his former boyfriend. I have to say that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
What's massive, even though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to figure out how they make their minds better, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> at a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to take your own self and <unk> what you ever pick, and it's under the ground, you get your <unk> cow your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live at envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show you. I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and asked for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the curse in Professor <unk> that criminal genius ...
But I've always said, <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief face of rat <unk> <unk> which needs to be <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in the fall of those mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the six-and-a-half <unk> once you walk in, <unk> to all of your solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him there's no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to shake your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> moved in the story, and I think this is very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the <unk> as an geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's on the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being <unk>
Could it be so simple?
What if <unk> are actually an issue of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> <unk>
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have the fiction to <unk>
Just <unk> the jealousy.
<unk> used <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> the scary <unk> was Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> <unk> Marcel <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July of bubbles, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11, and over the Sea of the <unk>
Armstrong and Aldrin were blind, but his presence on the surface of the <unk> was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest peace in time of peace in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of day today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave a couple of 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, universities and U.S. agencies.
They died people, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program was <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked over the surface, where they were commissioned by Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So, why do you sleep?
They didn't bring a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> then a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> the cynical answer is, because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice University -- give us a better idea.
John F. A few people ask, why do you sleep?
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you might also ask, why will we scale up the most <unk> mountain.
35 years ago, why are flying over the <unk>
Why does Rice <unk>
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the Moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> was not just a victory of the West about the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> to the transcendence of the technology of technology.
It was because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the Moon occurred in a very long list of technological access.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> and they eliminated smallpox.
Technology seemed to be what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For the most part of the history of humanity, we could not go faster than a horse, or a <unk> ship, but in 1969, the crew of the Apollo 10 flew 40,000 miles /
Since 1970, no human being has come back to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the crew of the Apollo 10, and the joyful <unk> about the power of technology has become <unk> to see that the technology would solve the way to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't belong to the <unk> tube of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was absolutely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that from "Something's happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard over the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like if the technologists had met us, and they were enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms or algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've widened and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation <unk> in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years to <unk> Intel Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused by creating ideas <unk> by funding for funding or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mainly what's wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their height of not worrying about the risk without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment investment, than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit of technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and which development is long-term capital -- not the long term. They have never invested in developing technologies because they don't have a commercial value immediately.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But to go to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from sources of renewable energy as the solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
The coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want to make alternative energy sources that can compete at price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and the economists agree about what policies and international <unk> development development -- a significant increase in research and development development, and some kind of control control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflects that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed technological, it turns out not to be.
We know from the time that famines are a result of failure to food <unk>
But 30 years of research have been taught that famines are political crisis that affects the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops and systems for storage and <unk> but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon was declared war to cancer in 1971, but soon we found out that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can have and we need to have these four elements of being <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must really be about a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, which is true of those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like John Kennedy -- there's not a politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and the dangerous, and there is not a popular <unk> of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the Moon it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't miss the challenge.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with the ideas that are <unk> that you have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a very general belief, of trust, is a very general belief,
The second one is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think that <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First <unk> why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And I turn to think that it may have fallen down in some activities or institutions and that could have escalated into others.
I don't have it.
But I can turn into opinion polls and opinion surveys.
When you look at research polls over time, there's not many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> about 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still a lot of <unk> Human nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average household of the street is almost exactly halfway halfway away.
But this is that enough?
What research polls are, of course, opinion.
What else can you do?
What they look at are the <unk> attitudes that people are doing when they do certain questions.
Would you go into the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
You probably want to ask, "So "What for?"
And that would be a very glamorous answer.
And you could say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust some other not."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> and a person or a person or a person is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could say, for example, I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the kind of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe maybe to hold a secret.
Simple.
And if we've gotten those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think the surveys are really bad tools to measure the real level of real self-confidence, because they're trying to pursue the good judgment of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid target.
Is it not that the goal that I <unk>
I would have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who would take their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
To have more confidence is not a smart objective in this life.
<unk> sitting or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yes, OK, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about to do a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the raw subjects and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not sick, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to bring a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would take their own <unk>
And I'm so glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is that we are talking to them before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional professionals, officials and so forth, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember once he was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> which will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we understand that the system of accountability of accounts that is meant to ensure <unk> and testing testing is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that we define <unk> as we say.
You must have all of the similar examples.
We were going to get all of that, by the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we are afraid of being worthy of trust and <unk> people who are reliable and if you want to figure out whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the time, the simple actions, the <unk> -- which doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the assignment to reconstruct the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct trustworthiness.
We can do it if it's two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately, it's signature because they give us a lot of other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations for enough for you to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to give you a sense of evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That goes on every day, everywhere, making the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks on my socks says I can <unk> not to give more.
I take them and get the money, or change the color of the color I want.
That's good. I rely on them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing is not very hard to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that grid, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginnings of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which imagination can be <unk>
This separation has become increasingly <unk> and more and more and more than today is from less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> display, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I wonder, and if I had no <unk>
I started imagining how to <unk>
First, I created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the hard drive against the screen transfers your physical body to the night.
Designers can prescribe their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool you break barriers.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the skill ability.
In the Computer Science division of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
We had a transparent bombsight with camera cameras to detect your fingers and the face, now you can lift your hands from the keyboard, to get inside the 3D space, and grab the pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in real space, which is as easy as taking a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and you can highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that sits down on every floating screen.
We architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will be bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them be physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my <unk> Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel up.
This imam magnet is behaving as a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere in this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of levitation and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And in programming the object, we release it from time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and get to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and light down, and the famous one takes from Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality that we want.
The students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike <unk> or textbooks or text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities of everyday activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but to start to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us from our world.
We started the talk today of a barrier, but if I took that barrier, the only boundary that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was pleased to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to <unk> a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After all, the Islamic Revolution, they believed firmly that there was only a precise path to <unk> a safe job, and <unk> work.
No matter if the job would like or not.
But my dream was to be an African opera village.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer, you have to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I also wrote to the director of the school and the speaker of a radio show.
But no adult would tell you the idea.
No adult took me serious.
Only my friends would tell me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me I wanted to <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I got to the United States in 1995, and what was the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda a strong <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave my habit of reading reading.
And so many perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to me because this is what students in China learn it.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields, like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why don't you do it in <unk> life.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
To <unk> <unk> are social, political and <unk>
For Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of getting out in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I alone or enjoy it.
Have a <unk> dream really isn't anything compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that I'm not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, where the passion, where happiness.
Until a broken dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client at all.
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch in my office and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My colleague of class had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to move your head while to <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> saying, Alex, and what I saw was right.
You start to work after that, then you have children after, until the death happens later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to eat.
But shortly after, my squad <unk> pushed me up to lobby that talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Sure, it's coming out of her category, under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry it."
And then my squad <unk> said, "It's still not no, but maybe it would be <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best moment to work in the marriage of Alex is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they do, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect time and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of the <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody comes to age without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yeah, they're amazing.
If you work with <unk> love a <unk> you love the dream -- a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be about 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments, they give them a way to their life have happened to be 30 and <unk>
People in the more 40, they don't <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or come out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth on their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change from themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that female fertility goes to its top to the 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time to take care of their body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who gets <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in an adult development.
But this is not what the people are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the time line of <unk>
Researchers call <unk> an extended <unk>
We journalists <unk> names of <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Not right?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "Do you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole to that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and absolutely nothing.
And then every day, smart intelligent, interesting people, like you or your children and the daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not really good for me, but I'm not <unk> I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while they start a career before 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts going to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better curriculum.
And then it starts going to sound like this: "My quotes on <unk> were like the game of the chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then sometime around the 30, she turned the music and all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds like a little bit of that, but it's not really high.
When you leave lots of things for <unk> there's a huge pressure to the 30 and so many of you start a career, pick a mate, to pick a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's a research that starts to show, which is a lot harder and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sporting cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
Can you realize that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give her brother to your child.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I, sitting in the room, and they talk about his <unk> "What was they doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the people are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said he'd like to work in art or entertainment, but she could still not decide, so that I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a very difficult life, his previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often <unk> in our <unk> but then she would get to say, "You don't pick your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day she got his head on his head and he cried for almost all the time.
I had just bought a new book to <unk> and it had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words -- "In case <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who's going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if he gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What she needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
She needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex like to just sit while the decade was going to go on front.
So, over the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or female, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that you would get away from that crisis of identity and <unk> capital capital.
For identity capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is a investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the career career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: <unk> identity creates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to test it.
I'm not <unk> exploration, <unk> I'm <unk> the exploration that shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration,
<unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and make them tell.
Secondly, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to get you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with some similar minds who know what they know about, how they think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who was coming out almost always comes from the nearest circle of its nearest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak ties of friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half don't, and the weak ties is the way we would engage with this group.
Half of the jobs ever created is never <unk> then, to meet the boss of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For last but not least, she believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon was going to spread to her family, when she has a couple of a couple of a couple of their own family.
I told her how long time to pick his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit on head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to pick the person who you live now or you're going to tell you now when everyone on Facebook start to walk toward the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means to be as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it will work or will be killing time with whoever you would get to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped her get a job there.
That labor supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who lived in.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves her new family, and I sent me a letter to say, "Now your emergency connections spaces are not enough.
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are like airplanes who come out from the Oxford Airport of Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the west.
Just before the <unk> a light on its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good order, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years, or even in the following generations.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to tell <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of telling the <unk> to the <unk> every day: <unk> aren't the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity capital, use their weak ties pick up your family.
Don't let them define for what they didn't know or what they didn't.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard work in management management for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach students mathematics to <unk> grade in New York City schools.
And as any professor, I took tests and tests.
Let me give you tasks.
When the job came, I would go to grades.
What struck me the attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have <unk> I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and so convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you have success in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how to fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of <unk> <unk> and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We are trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what kids would do as far as possible in the competition.
We studied teachers <unk> working in really hard neighborhoods -- what teachers still will be teaching for the end of the school and of <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, wondering, what about these marketers are going to keep their job work?
Who is going to make more money?
In all these different contexts, it emerged a trait as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health and not I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long-term goals.
The determination is to have resistance.
The determination is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years, and working hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who made my questionnaires of determination and then waited for about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that kids who were more determination had significantly higher likely to <unk> even when they <unk> them in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the tests, even the safety of the kids felt when they were at school.
So it's not only at West Point, or at the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for kids at risk for <unk>
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is how much we know the science of the development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we develop determination in kids?
What should I do to teach kids a solid ethical work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is talent is not <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are lots of visionary individuals who are simply not going on with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the absolute determination is not related or yet related to talent measures to talent.
Until now, the best idea I've ever heard about developing children is something called <unk> of <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not true that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they're much more prone to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our smarter, and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start everything again with the lessons that we can get.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
He <unk> in Taiwan, like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of Chinese characters.
From that time, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for a abroad it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been asking me if I can break down this <unk> so whoever you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language that can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and more simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic biology.
The first 200 people will allow you to understand 40 percent of basic literature enough enough to read <unk> <unk> signals, to understand the basic idea of the web or the paper.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you can possibly be <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, like shouting <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of the flame but I like to believe it is the other way. The one that works.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old west.
I call this eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old saying, two are a company, three are <unk>
If you stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a policeman like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Hold on a table under the tree, we have the foundations of them.
Walk a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --    -- to remember, because a tree speaker is quite an idiot.
Remember fire?
Two more together, it becomes very hot.
Three <unk> that's a lot of fire.
Walk the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Walk the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and night.
The sun goes out on the horizon.
A door. You put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Hold a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played one at home?
This person is leaving hidden from one door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, keep care of <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
When we use this approach, the first eight radical will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every single endeavor, they'll be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same thing as a Chinese learning for eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land.
This is a sun on the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where it comes out of the way out of it.
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and download from the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four, we saw the magician magician together.
The film <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic wand out.
But when you see that film as many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex share of childhood show.
However, the magician of Oz was a event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took spent 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal guy and a <unk> guy and a guy who was <unk> to a girl dressed as <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two movies, there are a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there is very little violence on the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz was doing today, the magician would say, <unk> you are salvation of Oz as a prophecy.
<unk> shoes to defeat the armies made by the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing from the magician of Oz is that the most compelling characters and wise characters are women.
I started to see this when I did see Star Wars <unk> a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a child.
three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had been <unk>  And so slid it in the room and I was very impressed by a mom and a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
I would have a sense of Luke a military to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do you win Dorothy your film?
We do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up, right? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much lethal capital force, in the movies for our children, and so little on the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence on girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know for experience that Princess Princess doesn't give me the proper framework that had served me to navigate through the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss really expected them to begin to come up, because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies actually focus on <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost as if by being a kid, you have to be an <unk> animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney at any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though them, they're not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend themselves against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend themselves from <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but not just stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times continues to come up in classic after classical, each of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a little girl.
So as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came back.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Remember what the critical criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's really good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies passed the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not being roots and <unk> but maybe we will start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book book and in the middle of the 1980s, he recorded a conversation that had had a friend on the evaluation of movies you saw.
And it's very simple. There are just three questions that you have to <unk> in the film, there is more than a young female character that I have lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women speak each other at some point in the film?
Your conversations are about something else than you like to <unk>  All right? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality, <unk> film.
Right? <unk> of <unk> successful <unk> a consensus idea of what's a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen to <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the food crisis.
We have lots of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations on this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Welcome to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 movies -- how many of them think they have protagonists
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently to Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a larger number than this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one of every five women said that it has been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the blame of massive entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with it.
I don't think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistician, one of the things that I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What does it do <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then getting the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very disturbing statistic and we want to make it <unk>
We have tools to our arrangement as <unk> <unk> and we hope that we would have to say, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> yes, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep your power <unk>
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is changing radically.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite character of Star Star Star Star <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just a brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that they know more than anybody, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and fight and fight only more stories where his work looked like to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and become better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things that I was most like was looking for sea biscuits on the shores of Maine, because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand, and it's hard to look at them.
However, with the time, I was pleased to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and the archeology.
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized I saw with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, had grown up to one of almost 1,300 miles away along with the <unk>
And my biscuits of sea had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew it had to do differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern Delta. of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in simple sight, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks as pink <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape of building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find an old <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> them in the red circles here, but somewhere inside of this enormous set of <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> per mile high.
Early on, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, they moved to this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
I'll try and find it at random to look at a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So, we use NASA NASA to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, that we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists doing <unk> they can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, under a thick thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location, five feet down, we have a <unk> layer of several hundred years ago that date out of the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found the jobs of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which proves that there was a <unk> workshop.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used to take off the jewelry, of the Middle Empire of the Middle Empire these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense <unk> layer that comes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite armed workshop that proves that what's been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but they will go back to the place in a very close future.
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also do great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire probably been written in <unk> four years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the most <unk>
There's nothing like that.
So according to it seems like TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas actually started in 1984 <unk> C in a lost town, not long and found from high high.
It certainly puts the search for sea <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door to <unk> home.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we have a group of <unk> <unk> in bicycles.
They're competing on a <unk> career <unk> and they go back to your front door.
I need to look at this <unk>
They are <unk> strong, they're <unk>
They collide against the door of her home.
There are bikes flying everywhere, wheels that goes on their side, lightning on the wheels that end up in places -- <unk> the threshold of the gate, the door.
So the lobby, to the hall or what has to be on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that you talk about.
You can feel your blue <unk> yourself, tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> you're about to get into your mouth.
<unk> on one side and they trained his living room.
Already in the room, and doing most of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
This is time with little clothes dancing about her <unk> singing <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now I go to the kitchen.
The soil has been coated with a yellow <unk> path from the oven come to you <unk> the <unk> man and the Len of "The Wizard of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping towards you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> of <unk>
There were several men and a few different <unk> and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers looking at them just once.
And the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
We had entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize faster the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be true of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and who has one of the best <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I am not a wise.
I actually have a average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition says they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miracle acts of memory using some old manufacturing techniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that he used to <unk> to memorize their addresses, and that medieval academics used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How do you not heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competence, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English and brilliant English and a little <unk> he said, "You know, you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why is that?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order to <unk> on a national television room.
That would prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
Or do you have to start with something <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memories was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see to what about our memory we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> In he <unk> for the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, I read a number of treaties on the memory written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> and disciplined memory wasn't just as rare as it can look like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they have also changed.
They have changed the same, and I would argue that they have changed our cognitive too.
As we have already no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people are passionate about this idea of a disciplined <unk> and disciplined memory is this kind of competition as unique to memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are facilities like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know, will be that it has brains in some way, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and meaningful difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with that <unk>
When they put them on an fMRI scanner, they <unk> their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that on memory champions are spreading parts of the brain, different to others.
It was actually <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? Is there something that we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driving as an armed race where every year, someone has a new way to remember more things, faster and then the rest of the competitors should put up a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times of memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> <unk> which he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
Yeah. Yeah.
And while there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used by the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It's true with a fancy paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says this: I tell two people who remember the same word. I tell you to you, you know, there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, "You know, there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
You know, what would you say?
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who was told that his work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name doesn't really mean anything to you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance for his head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They do well when they come home to work.
You probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you take that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is over and a half thousand years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's called the <unk> of the <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet named <unk> I attended a <unk>
They had hired him as a entertainment, because before, if he wanted to give a very good party, it doesn't come to a <unk> they would get to a <unk>
He stood up there, he would take his poem out of memory, and he <unk> and as soon as it was -- the hall of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed them all, but it shattered the bodies to <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were sitting there.
So you could not be able to get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed his eyes and realized that with your eyes of his mind, I could see where he'd been sitting every single time.
I took the family <unk> to where his loved ones were on the rubble.
What they <unk> I noticed at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or numbers or instructions or instructions -- word of the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you tell me that I would tell you, the first 10 words of history that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet if you would tell you to say who was sitting on the horse and she could be able to <unk> it in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with your eyes of your mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it is the image -- it will be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from memory, the same way that you would think about it, if you were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous idea, crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing that you want to say is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote that you want to tell.
And then I walked into the kitchen, and the fourth theme that I would talk to you would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
So it's like the <unk> <unk> <unk> the word -- not word for word, who is going to confuse it but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people were thinking about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his memory palace would be.
I saw that this was simply fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory <unk> and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> boring.
Actually, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting by taking exams. I mean that the most exciting thing happens is when someone went off the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put me in your place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was entertaining.
I would never have expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What it's really about doing is to make it better and more the ability to create and imagine these images <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was pretty excited about this.
This is me, using my standard team of training for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some of the safety <unk> covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because red is the worst enemy of a <unk> memory.
And I ended up coming back back to the same contest that had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could put in a sort of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for me for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment was out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
And of course it's nice to be able to memorize speeches and numbers on the telephone, and you go shopping, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they are based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit with a bit of insights about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
Big memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
You know, when we focus deeply deeply.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing sort of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of <unk>
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what <unk> the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what our short existence is already -- in the <unk> or you will not pay attention to the human being in front of us, who walks on our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even bother to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are potential memory capabilities all over us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years of history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so it will be <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I was living there on my parents in a town called <unk> and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was playing with my sister.
And between my bedroom.
And there you all spend the TV TV, so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everyone was looking at me, and every time I stood up, and I came back into a <unk> all of you see me.
And I was like this.
It was ready, not safe and hated it.
I hated that <unk> I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
That's right.
Those feelings I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, because architecture is not about mathematics, and it's not about those connections that are emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental <unk> <unk>  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture is determines us in ways we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would think about is <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it for based on a building built and a half thousand years ago, by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection. We've used this trick for a much, long time.
We used it 200 years ago.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these cool <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very helpful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we met with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the <unk> Public Library -- which is finished in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, it has a <unk> has this round of it: <unk> brick red, which you leave <unk> what <unk> is about communicating with this <unk> the children, the property values the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, the other library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> the architects that are constantly driving new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's lives.
We were going to get it out and we gave them so much, that we get away from the people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no other choice.
We have to go on the other side and get to connect to those <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experience how we can swing the pendulum back forward, over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course we've done it in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago we did the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> tiny, <unk> scale.
A really hard thing.
So we get to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We will take the leader on the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added up a load and use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned it into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes are <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time at commercial centers, we moved to the slums, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> at the French or the French or at Italian.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy. They're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we create memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not <unk>
This is Ohio.
We architects feel frustrated and we start to get the leader on the other direction.
In the '80s and the early 1990s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we have now with new <unk> design techniques to the computer, and we find ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are going on against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally the pendulum is <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> scholars and public and general agreed about a building.
The New York Times, <unk> this construction of <unk>
<unk> increase in a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and he was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these ways, wild and <unk> how it's possible that they are becoming ubiquitous across the world?
And it happened, because the media will spread around them, and we quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The major mayors of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennium country with other star.
It happened to <unk> and <unk> and what happened to these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, in the new millennium, actually started to happen with all of architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about how we consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, would have to have been walked up to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> you can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we all are photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so quickly.
It doesn't take a long time to think of a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before we know if that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find with buildings like this.
<unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much of them <unk>
That's never going to happen. Because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when the media is applied, when the media applies to media, start to swing faster and faster, until you're going to be on both extremes almost in <unk> and it will effectively be the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a town called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a holiday community.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already a part of the community, and like the drawings looked exactly at the end, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal storytelling, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other, what we think about architecture, because digital media not only changed the relationship between us, but they changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> to the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique answer to what a library can be like.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are not those very mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and one is not an <unk> public that doesn't take something that has never seen before.
The architects can listen and you can't be left by architecture.
That means that the Hudson <unk> of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> <unk> historical brick based on ideas of what a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for the shapes that will produce.
That means that buildings will spread to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking lot in Miami, in Miami, Florida, it can also serve to make sports or for <unk> or even one can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East <unk> New York City <unk> and raise half a million dollars of the community around that cause, is no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we care about is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> more <unk> and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot at stake.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they give them a way to the most unequal spaces, the local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the turn of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does that very typical way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves her reflex.
He <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves the big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it, and I thought, "When did I stop doing this?
How do we suddenly taste with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at show. "I am <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, it just wants to be dear to fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week, in school.
It has a bit of fear, it's a bit confused because, despite his mom that his mom says all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
Between what his mom says and what his friends or colleagues in school are told, he doesn't know who believe.
So a video of her himself, he played it on YouTube, and he does it on YouTube, and he asks others to leave a <unk> "I'm nice or <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal healthy teenager, which gets these answers to one of the most vulnerable vulnerable vulnerable of life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it bringing them to do this?
Well, teenagers today almost never are alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this never is over.
Never before we have been so connected to a continuous way, so I'm so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like a party in his room all <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, being connected to being connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of liking people who have and the comments that they do.
There is no division between a online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it's not.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what is tested.
What is the highlight of the life of someone in front of someone in front of someone in the face of a day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> size continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who are <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But kids aren't immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars in sports, and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow up healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to look at their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects start to be suffering.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because you think you don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk>
They're fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as human beings and to the field of working development.
31 percent, almost one of every three teenagers are not interested in the discussions of class. <unk> participating in the classroom of classroom because they don't want to call attention for their physical appearance.
One in five are not attending at all the days at all days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the rainy season, if you don't think you look at it good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're happy enough. <unk> a smaller note to the average of your fellow who don't care about what it looks like.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, America and China.
And it gets independently of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be good of course, we're talking about how you see, not how you really are.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> <unk> performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with time do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they're involved in more diet and vegetables, they participate in more diet not healthy than they can bring them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them, and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think this is all about what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and of drugs, diets <unk> aesthetic <unk> sexual relations at early ages and no protection and damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether or they have no higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to an interview interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way they look like.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, which would be that demonstration.
We have this potential for interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, I'm talking, for itself, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms, the first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are lots of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that many <unk> programs without realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that follow our kids is not only going to have a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six different aspects are crucial starting for anyone who would be willing to bring an body self-esteem to work.
One education is a fundamental way, but facing this problem requires each of us to take charge of us, and let's be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
It's challenging the current status of how women are seen, and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the contribution of our politicians in slices of hair, or the size of your <unk> or the <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people for what they are, not as they look like.
We can all start by doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time that you would have a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and businesses, to really change our culture, so that our children grow up valuing their entire person, valuing the individuality, diversity, <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them come out of the big screen because we will just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think you see that they will never be <unk> of being those who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
Your <unk> A <unk>
It could just be the woman who is about two car seats, what would it mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice in her interior, he would kill him for not having long legs -- more <unk> a <unk> <unk> little <unk>
What would it mean for her if we would take this up, and we would say that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the imagery is <unk> to everyone.
But let's take our children the truth.
You know, the way you see is just one part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and why they make us feel.
We would go to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of one year of today, they become safe agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
The five November of November 1990, a gentleman called <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Women's Defense <unk>
To <unk> initially would be said to me, but being a prisoner for other minor charges in the company of others, started planning on attacks to about 12 icons in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
For luck with those plans to become an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb on the World Trade Center couldn't be stopped.
Later on, it would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh, being a <unk> engineer with a loving American American <unk> teacher from the two made possible for giving me a happy childhood, <unk>
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact with, it doesn't need a lot to get to look at the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in every human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who were getting themselves so <unk> to their convictions that thinks they have to use all the possible media to everyone lived as them.
A few months before arrest him and explained to me and explained to me that in the last weekends, he and some friends had been going to training it on Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I played my father -- my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot gave the little orange light on the goal and to surprise you, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the rest and Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
<unk> such child.
All of us, the comment made a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting up with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot in the World Trade Center in causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood allowed me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone already was time to pack and go to another town.
As it was always me the new face of the class was a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret <unk> my identity to avoid being the white, but to be the new of the class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have a social skills, to say it <unk> to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> opera, judge people, based on <unk> indicators as his race or his religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way to think, was during the presidential election elections.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence as I had been a victim of <unk> almost all of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who had done friendship, was Jewish people.
I took a number of days to come out of light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of having been able to beat the barrier that all of my life had been done to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came in when I got a summer job in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental about the development of my character.
The whole life was taught that <unk> was a sin and for extension, all the gay were bad <unk>
By the way, I had a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the tiniest and less critical and less critical that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a kid, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others. But it wasn't easy for me to try and enjoy exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be love, but I know what it is to be <unk> around my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me become honest with my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation. They have nothing to do with character.
In many ways he became my shape <unk> at a moment that I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that an Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my own life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something I would keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep that hatred on your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put me on a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else is going to try to take violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, that although I was inspired by this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do that by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones -- because of their loved pain and loss that terrorism has produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism -- talking against those acts of terrorism, as well as rejection of my father.
So with this one, I put here as proof that violence is not inherent for any religion or race that children don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there is a film that projects in your minds.
It's an incredible film.
It's in 3D, and it has sound <unk> of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> flavor and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as a moment of your childhood moments project to your eyes.
And it has constantly superimposed voice into your conscious thought.
The heart of the movie is you who experiences everything live.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of human being.
Every one of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie of you, you, you and you.
There's nothing to do more directly.
At least, I know I have a <unk>
I don't have certainty that you are aware.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just the robots that we need to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible to be impossible for consciousness.
The science, by nature, is an objective one.
<unk> for nature, is subjective people.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all of the 20th century, we would take that vision.
The psychology was studying behavior -- <unk> neuroscience is the <unk> brain -- but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of a scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic job that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science.
We know that these brain areas are connected to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to tell you that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to the <unk>
Actually, there is no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real central mystery of this <unk> why all of the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The standard <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how are the <unk> how <unk> how do they work, how are they going to adapt and regulate living organisms all are questions about the target work.
That could apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> <unk> how we talk about how we speak, how we do -- how we do -- how do we play <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the simple problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it's all behavior accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm.
I'm a heart scientist of heart.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that would work. For a long time, I would beat your head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we were <unk> at this point.
We have a range of wonderful variation, <unk> we used to get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology, explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
We don't know how to seat that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't really know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning, crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such problem in consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or illusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the <unk> the behaviors of the brain -- and this is what it needs all that needs to be <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the awareness of consciousness is satisfying.
But I am in a different direction.
In the time you get there, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is essential.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building space, the time and the mass.
<unk> laws are fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic <unk>
Instead, they're considered principles, and it's built the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, time, <unk> law laws, and then I applied the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas <unk> space, time, <unk> load, then by a matter of logic, you have to get the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> as a fundamental <unk> a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that all of a sudden it's not really the object of science.
It opens up the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that govern awareness with other fundamental concepts -- space, space, time, -- mass, processes.
physicists are sometimes saying that we want fundamental laws as simple as we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws of fundamental laws that we can tell them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, <unk> by the mind, every system is aware, not just humans, the dogs, the mice, the flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with anguish when you think God, always travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thinking is that maybe photons can have some element of crude feeling, <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This can sound a bit crazy for you.
How would someone thought something so <unk>
This is part of the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's a fundamental way, the time and the mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason it comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful shape of finding fundamental laws that we will <unk> thinking with the physical process -- is <unk> awareness with information.
Whenever you have information processing, there is awareness.
<unk> of complicated <unk> as in a human being, a human <unk>
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of integration of information, which measures <unk> which measures the level of integrated information into a system.
And it's supposed to be <unk> it has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a level of integration of information, as a meaningful degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, you particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is <unk> but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different awareness of zero.
In fact, a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers often have observed that the physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies underneath.
As explains Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come out of the <unk>
From the <unk> view, the equations of physics can leave you as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts it in my equations.
In that vision, consciousness isn't found outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's there in the center.
So this vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have very serious social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that I had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you will be hungry.
I think it really tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in terms of ethical and <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
And the vision of <unk> information is kind of processing complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have really serious ethical problems about the ethics ethic of smart computers and the ethics ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the collective consciousness of the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED Talk -- at this point, we have a collective collective awareness -- an inner movie for this whole group of TED movies that are inside each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that you must have seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a fundamental thing to be universal.
The vision raises many questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and I love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait at the night to the morning.
But I think we're finally going to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile of education.
I went to school, I was excited about my friends, I was scared with my younger sisters.
It was very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a real problem.
She hasn't actually gotten anything.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a beneath the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, yes. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I was doing nothing extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered if you take disability outside the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching at a second part of teaching in a high school school, so only after about 20 minutes in the middle of the 11 days, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give him your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk>
When people on the wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Normally in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had experiences with disability with disability as objects of inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not the fault of the chap, that is true for many of us.
For us, the disability people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people, we are there to inspiring.
And in fact, I am on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to tell you, right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid to be <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you've lied to us in relation to disabilities.
Yes, they have been sold to the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital <unk>
Is it something wrong and living with a disability makes you fantastic <unk>
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you fantastic <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before we <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
It may have seen one, of the child without drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with a carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because you have a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disabilities in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, because of my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I have been talking about <unk> <unk> to express that you think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I stood up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, these images are attached to people with disability to the benefit of people without disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is really hard.
So we would have a few things.
But the things that we are missing, isn't the things that you might think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was amazed by the so-called social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more conservative, because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures too.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies by taking away the best of their ability.
So, it's really <unk> in the way we do, as sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have been sold by this lie that disability makes us exceptional interesting.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration and you think, "Oh my God, you are not sometimes inspired by something for something else.
And I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I am lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall around --  -- <unk> the ingenious trick of how to load the battery battery on the battery of your chair.
Great.
We learn about the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and <unk>
I really think that that lie that have been sold about disability is the largest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a stairs hasn't done it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> before a television screen will not make the subtitles for people to <unk>
Neither is a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitudes to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered no <unk> of nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> by getting out of bed and remembering our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a kid on 11 grade in <unk> is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair.
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but to question what you think about what you think about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to do is augmented reality and professional soccer with <unk>
And what is the average rate of a <unk> <unk>
And unfortunately, I just answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would have to engage with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what's running through the field of <unk> to 160 <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a man out of 110 pounds is <unk> trying to <unk> all his way.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
You know, some videos to show you what you can use Google <unk> under the hull, and give you an idea of it.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the <unk> practices because the idea of the <unk> technology is a sub going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have noticed that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> by <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling to be in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in <unk>
You fans want that experience.
You guys want to be in the field, being your favorite self, and have asked me at YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
<unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we get to <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that you probably know you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why why, with this video.
Man: Oh, oh!
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What would be the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> of a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What's the experience of a fan experience.
When it can be <unk> running for the <unk> launching the ball to the bottom of the network?  Or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What's your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it <unk> the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> reality when <unk> <unk> and owners would see the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They gives them money.
So, here's a brief clip about technology in <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to go.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, I was just placed radios on the <unk> of the field <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that it's a player coming back to your group, and you see your next move you shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you take on. You don't have to worry about stopping a <unk>
Or to <unk> the strategy.
They just go out to the field and look at it.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they're <unk> and they hate to lose games.
If you lose parties <unk> you would get <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium -- having a view from how high the people are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information, you send them to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad guys will have information <unk>
This is going to take good teams of the bad ones.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and analysis analysis to stop being done for nerds.
It will be also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's the field.
Do you have the ball and <unk>
We go to an open receiver all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Typically, not <unk> it, but the <unk> system will come up.
It was <unk> to the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> that there's an open fly.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you land, but the receptor sees in your bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can alter the race.
It's <unk> it takes the <unk> running and <unk>
The public audience, and fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
You fans want to be in the ground.
Do you want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as a bread and you try and interact with our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy among human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad your actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay <unk> in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they are being <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets closer.
The questions we make, the choices we take and the challenges that we face, to protect ourselves as the time.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years was the <unk> the end of the <unk> county in <unk> County, which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure called the <unk> of the beautiful <unk> of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> an engineer head of building the bridge said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from his openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you think that travel between the two towers will bring them to another <unk> this bridge has been <unk> as a sense of it, that each of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact on the <unk> the bones, some of which will be vital organs.
Most of the <unk>
The ones that no, normally you get into the water <unk> and then it <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this suicide method will realize to the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the cord.
Except, about the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are before to get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at its darkest time, it's very difficult to bring you back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to an official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those of us who were dropping suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Now today, officers and psychologists train the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met the 22 last year when you get a call from a possible suicide <unk> sitting on the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with a <unk> Golden Golden <unk>
Jason had only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up here two times before from New Jersey to try <unk> from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked us if we knew the story of the box <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and she was.
This kind of kind and smart guy in New Jersey had just got to get my life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how he was.
The parents of Jason had asked him.
<unk> damage will affect a lot of people.
I give you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone else was <unk>
What would you say?
Did you say?
In my experience, it's not just to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels like because you probably don't know.
It's just being there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't have a afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing their life, you've had these <unk>
They would go to the person in front of us can save life and be the tipping point for them.
Other signs of despair, despair, despair, to believe that things are terrible, and that you never go to <unk> to believe that there's nothing you can do with the <unk> social isolation and a lost interest of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son at January January this year, and he wrote this email back, just a couple of days ago, and he is with his permission and blessing to read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go back to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends that tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the car car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real mental illness.
It must not be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go through the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go on.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of 2005, I wrote to a radio call for a possible <unk> subject on the bridge near the bridge near the northern tower.
I got my father on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me immediately <unk> the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and the next hour I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided by his account that day to come back on that lane and give her life another opportunity.
When Kevin came up with it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did <unk> and gave him hope and life <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I <unk>
And you left me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of 11 <unk> and you are one of the reasons why Kevin remains with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I took Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, like he said.
We give God for you.
<unk> right with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of the end, she wrote, <unk> when I visited the General <unk> at San Francisco at the night, you were <unk> as the patient.
I know that I did have to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
He talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with hope that their story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, stealing the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide does.
For most people who considered suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
And by the general thing, this is achieved just three or three things: drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and suicide calls around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I got my hand on three times.
In the end, it looked at me, and he said, "I am sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
Furthermore, those few who have jumped out of the bridge, and they lived and you can talk about it, that one percent of those people have said that the second one who stopped side, they realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect to us with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be able to work to do.
Pain can prevent.
There is help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inner you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you think about that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I was finally able to have had the dream that I'd had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, to the ones that I'm going to talk about later, when I look at this picture -- I'm thinking, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm beginning.
We all love our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin in the color of skin or belief from all around us.
They're people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I had <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt in my head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing this t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never invited me to share my story, not because I thought it will be bad, but why the world comes to those of us who want to do it.
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, my dad and a family who tells me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a goddess <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> and <unk> and he won in the bathroom <unk> she won in <unk> I won a <unk> and she was a third finalist between 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of the <unk> of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first work was Queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I was <unk> to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. He had moved to San Francisco, I called me and told me that I passed my application to the green card that I could go to live in the United States.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called it and said, "You know that if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I would give him two <unk> to my name.
She also sat down when I was <unk> at Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand to do the most sophisticated sophisticated and safe surgeries to do the surgeries in Thailand to do the most.
At that time in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before changed the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in his truth, but that, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that you live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 November, we do a global vigil for <unk> <unk>
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people that are <unk> and it was standing up to injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer there are more <unk> than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. First, thank you all my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, to my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times that I have gone to young women who have <unk> and a few times, when they called me and told me that his parents couldn't take it, and I took my mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Some of them worked out -- it's not just gender identity, that's what's at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table the question that sometimes that I didn't block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice.
In many hunter-gatherer societies, tribal societies, the parents usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education by defending their rights in 2007. And when they took their efforts in 2011, the National Prize <unk> of peace, was made very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm her father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of <unk> of inequality and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies, right from the beginning, when I was born, a girl, his birth is not <unk>
He's not welcome and for his mother, nor for her mother.
The neighborhood comes back, gives her mother to mother and no one who was <unk>
And a mother was getting a lot to have a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, the first daughter, gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he said, his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only <unk> but the daughter. The youngest daughter when it grows, it is too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays home and school admits of his brothers.
At age of 12, in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you need to take away from your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and her family and his family, and if you were to tell the code of that course honor, you could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this code of honor, not only the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of her sisters in behalf of the name of honor.
And there's a more norm of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of their father and their mother, even if they don't want to.
If you compare it to a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with a old man has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If the <unk> too young has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson from your children.
And this vicious cycle continues and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I was extremely <unk>
And so much before I was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter so for her.
But when I was married, they were all men, and I grabbed my feather, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half years and a half years old in my school.
You might be wondering, why should I tell you about a little girl at a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of your identity and his name.
One <unk> means that it's entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and no one of them could go to school, and they would be treated two weeks earlier, when they did <unk> the form of a tourist <unk> and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason value to my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters not to his daughters, thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate intelligence and <unk> my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
It would go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school for girls and girls for the same.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
He taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk> lesson.
<unk> brothers and sisters, paid for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal rights for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation in all of the economic and economic activities and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
<unk> were banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog of the BBC, he was offered her for the documentaries of the New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could back.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and the nine in October 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would tell my own ear to my wife -- "I must <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't tell you."
<unk> the fair cause.
You take your life in play by the cause of the <unk> by the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words were going to take a lot to me, and I didn't ask again.
When <unk> was in the hospital and had severe severe headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm fine with my smile, and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to give you fine. Please don't <unk>
It was a solace for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters have learned from her to resist in the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16 year-old girl.
<unk> when you don't run his task.
You fight your siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about special in my <unk> which has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain about 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the Google visualization -- but all the work I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or out of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation,
You are still just as smart or not?
Is it not going to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And immediately after the operation, I had to figure out how to make, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I did nothing, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals and trying to <unk> to keep going.
More than I've saved my little bit.
But luckily, I have <unk> soul for what I decided to do to try to get the <unk> dose, because there really doesn't exist a map that says it in <unk>
I started to test with different mixes and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the dose were dramatically about, my sense of who I was, my way of thinking about my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I made doses and different chemicals for a <unk> man and I was amazed by looking at how I looked at my thoughts.
I was always thinking, I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several types of things, or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that had on the front, and it just wouldn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and about what they have to do -- since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to do to do to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was to recover my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
We would think about almost always in pictures, and that became my point of key <unk> how I can get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk> new situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes can see things in similar ways.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are people who refer to this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind works, for me, it's simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to the <unk> and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I get to find the point right and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take good to these mental imagery of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use its imagination only to lead the world to the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music from your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like how creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups leading by two groups in neuroscience.
They both use MRI technology, an fMRI imaging to represent the brain, and here you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues from Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The column of the medium shows the scan of the brain that the same individual as you get in, looking at that same image.
The column on the right is created by the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagining that same picture.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos in YouTube while they were taking their brains to create a large signal of reaction to the video sequences in the video.
And then I showed you a film with new, new, new people, new animals, and as long as it becomes a new <unk>
The computer -- using only the brain information from the scan -- to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're well close to it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you can imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This is been conducted with the largest brain scanning systems today, and their resolution has increased like a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we do it?
There are lots of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't give you for that.
A lot of people are proposing new techniques from projection to images, even me, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- we must first ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get biggest resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer little improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of the bigger magnets we make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a great amount of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> and brilliant solutions are <unk> and <unk> in the radios and receivers of FM radio systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field -- it comes to <unk> magnetic patterns <unk> at the frequencies of radio radio.
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing patterns, we can increase massive amounts of information that you can take out into a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our growing knowledge of the brain structure and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the fluid fluid, but the <unk> hormones and the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and maybe even the direct neural activity. This is sleep.
We will be able to put our ideas to direct ideas to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how to learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use as a tool to amplify our skills and communication.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's disease and similar diseases.
We have a few choices more than opening up this door.
Anyway, you pick a year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine going to take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Your closet may be telling you a person for the first time that someone is pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have ever done in life.
So everything else is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've experienced and have come out of that closet that's universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be <unk> that by the <unk> of my own <unk> and for me to get my head back, I would usually ask a child -- "Hey, you're a kid or a <unk>
And it would appear a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, it would take me a coffee with a leave of <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I would say nothing and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight it.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised me that next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had quotes with Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina <unk> I <unk>
So I took a deep deep down and down my back, a four-year-old girl with a pink dress -- looking at what it's not a challenge for an <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a guy or a question: "You're or <unk>
So I took it back into a little bit again, I stood up with it, and I said, "Hey, I know that this is confusing,
I have the short hair like the one of a boy, and you saw clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress -- and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more of the kind of girl in a <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and it has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was just "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us went through with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some aspects in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how a sense of living in a closet.
That's how my thinking is not unlike yours or yours or yours.
I would give you a hundred reasons for why to get out of my closet that was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> the hard is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that it will explain to someone who have declared online banking is harder than telling him that it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult than telling your five-year-old son who are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there is only the hard thing.
We have to stop taking what we have to do with respect to how difficult to make us feel better or worse in relation to our cabinets and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can do security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and a high school shoes.
I wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight any <unk> for any <unk>
I was frozen by the fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay <unk> and moving only one muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers with whom I've spent my entire life trying to <unk> and now the world was turning on purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed by so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my <unk> launches was in the wedding of my sister.
It was the first time that a lot of the guests knew that it was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> they knew in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally got to one where my friends were from my parents' parents, people who knew me I was years old.
And after I spoke to a moment, one of the women cried -- Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in St. Petersburg.
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
You know, what is your TV dream show.
Our favorite Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but I wait to show desperately his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said to me, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts to do it.
And I had an opportunity at that time, like you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to tell where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find out and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing you want.
That's how hard conversations are still without being my strong.
Ask anybody with whom I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be true <unk>
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others should know we also suffer.
Number two: Be a <unk> Just <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of them can come out of safe injured -- so they would get out of what they've done, but they're never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you may feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very yourself, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So, what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has seen -- an productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think is as interesting as the question of if a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism and computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
We start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or you don't have some of the intelligence on Earth, but you have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know anything about it, that doesn't have any concept about the Earth, you would be forced to develop a physics theory that would explain how to a certain point in time, the asteroids that we would take on the surface of a planet -- they just stop it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program I took a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be discovered for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for development of human states that we prescribe the diversity of potential future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic motion, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different subjects and <unk> together, I said, from a number of years ago, and there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is a force, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open choices with a force T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, yes, until an impending future, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the open.
And so, having to figure this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have been suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have trend to more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence has a more <unk> relationship.
What if smart behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but that actually starts directly from it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize production of entropy long-term entropy in any system where you find it.
<unk> <unk> could go through multiple evidence of animal intelligence, play computer games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of it without anything else to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Like a foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided by his account to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is to have applications for humanoid robotics and human assistance.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Furthermore, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling opposite sides of a string at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can actually do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections to a social network where friends are constantly injured, and keeps the network very connected.
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering success and using the Panama Canal to expand the global scope from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of <unk> <unk> <unk> increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability to risk management will have tremendous applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of human cognitive behaviors such such as using tools, walk upright and social ability, all flow from one single equation, which leads to a system to maximize your future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the use of the use of the term <unk> the work <unk> there was always the concept that if you were smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion would have been a <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest implications of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we have had the concept of the rebellion in the other way.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the other thing that the impulse to take control of every single future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence is actually going to arise directly from taking control, rather than the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
And I often ask me, how do you look for goals to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence, the following: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the matter of the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how Earth fits into the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets that orbit other stars, which is pointing to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint <unk> intensity of the stars when planets go ahead of them, and blocking a bit of that light that will come to us.
The data collected by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance that there are between them and their mother.
And together, this helps us to understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the land planets of our solar system, and also the number of light that gets from their own.
Instead, this gives clues about if these planets that we find are livable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of worlds that are potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
2014 was the hotter record.
<unk> and ocean ice that have been with us for millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have moved quickly to our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a scientific scientist, no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the search search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more you look for planets like the Earth, the way I enjoy our own planet.
Every one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the past planet and the planets that we know better: our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world, demonstrated this by a mission like the Kepler <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, is why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> as the <unk> are tracking its surface, looking for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not only short space flights but also the <unk> possibility to live on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images remind us the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas of <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still stay with <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and most cold places on Earth is fresh and full of oxygen attached to our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this enthusiasm for the colonization of Mars and other planets down with the colonization of Mars and the belief of some that Mars and belief is to wait for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
For a lot of that I like exploration, <unk> I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will comment on the captain of the Titanic that I really will have place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for exploration and climate preservation are not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
Only you find them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile zones of the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
So let me leave you with an experiment. The paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, considering that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the life of alien life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to have been advanced enough to think of living between the stars, lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that just the colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration, <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to join the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table where there was <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and all were closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time on it, and it was cold.
I couldn't get home from my friend of Jeff to spend night, because I had a flight early in Europe in the next morning, and I took my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but sure not more expensive than a <unk> at the night, so I thought, despite the circumstances that I was very stopped.
I'm a profession, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases your heart rhythm, and the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the <unk> counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that could put out in place, which would be wrong with bad things.
Or at least, if it happens, bad things, you know, the probability of a total catastrophe is happening.
So I started thinking about that, but until one month later my thoughts, <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I talked to him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he had been practicing something called retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, and then try and figure out what it can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, it takes a place for things that are <unk>
This sounds of common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space <unk> works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make track of the important things, where the fish are fine, where the fish are, where the fish are <unk> where the tribes and friends live in.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows them to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut off the <unk> sense of <unk> and they could still find his nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that are moving too much.
This is the reason for losing your car or <unk> <unk> and <unk>
So at home, you put a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular chair.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they're <unk> with it all your things will always be there when you get them.
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card license, or your car, or <unk> <unk> for them to be in the cloud.
If these things are <unk> or <unk> this can be <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at best, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there is perhaps not more stressful than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of making medical decisions, and in fact for decision-making financial decisions and social decisions and any kind of decision that you have to take out of the fact that a rational contribution of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart attack, heart stroke of it.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most mundane drugs in the world today, even you're likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yeah, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you must ask for that most physicians don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is it that <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to engage a surgery on any medical procedure, before they help a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's someone's guilt about scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> which do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help one person?
300.
This according to the research of researchers cynical <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, brain stroke or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> of the effects. Okay?
For this particular drug, the side effects produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things that are <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The Five percent is not very likely to happen to me, even so taking the <unk>
But one time.
Remember, under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how you do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking on the spot.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has taken five percent of the 300 percent side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug you can help you to help you.
I don't say you should not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your physician.
<unk> medical ethic is part of the principle of informed consent informed itself.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the biggest men in the top of the prostate for cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only will give you one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before you have the questions that you can say to us that we will take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the event.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a more short life of pain, or a longer life than you could have a lot of pain at the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you are trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems turned out.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Happy to face with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get the lunch lunch and so nothing matters.
And unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown this.
So we need to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail then.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> could be those <unk> to put the systems into the place that will help you to minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I went off at the night of snow in <unk> when I returned from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination along with the door, with a key to the gate of the entrance to the itself, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of email messages I haven't seen.
So I'm not quite organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: So <unk> <unk> is my favorite answer.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there, there it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can come to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the <unk> of signs, the <unk> in addition to my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over the time of time, it mixed with local signs, and it developed the language that we know today as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years old.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I believed it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign world, is like I lived in a foreign country, following <unk> <unk> behaviors and norms of <unk>
So how do I understand sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
I have learned, for example ...
"I don't know <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, not <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm a <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that's coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
<unk> for it to keep going.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see the <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines contain sound through the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In the culture of the culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, to make my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had a chance to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my area of art.
I'm going to tell you more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that not just experiences through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And all I had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the arts community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power, <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art work, or I could tell you.
I chose to get it wrong.
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if he didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as equal and become my voice.
I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in school, and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> your voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value that is like taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If you're not going to continue to do this practice, I feel that I could go on to the forget and not have any kind of social value.
So with the sound as my new artistic medium, <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't be capturing and to express fully on paper.
And the same thing can be said from a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> highly <unk> which means subtle changes can affect all meaning both of the signs as much as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide into many different <unk>
If you translate a different <unk> for each finger as the facial expression -- the speed, the shape of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand and so, as the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if it is <unk> just a key at the time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way, to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If only one key would change it, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing with music in terms of <unk> <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and you would turn it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun goes out and it gets on.
This is all day."
If you look at it, and it <unk> the visually speed, you see as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said about <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time expresses time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, we will go back again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think we would automatically think of <unk>
Look at <unk> right, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of us in high high.
Now we're going to do it so much in your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third one, please, <unk> again.
And again.
Is it <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job. All right.
So look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen on your head and the chest -- but it makes very different meanings of meanings on it.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and suffering, like music.
However, today, we live in a very small world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have any sound automatically -- it doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines the social value and allowing them to grow their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> not that you have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a treasure trove of trove and I'd like the same experience.
I'd like to help you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can do it all, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, and where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a innocence of innocence or a ignorance bubble -- I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the awful truth.
When I got older, I learned that the adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning up each other.
Time country, now I'm an adult and I teach civil and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk around the beach <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And over the last few decades, we have been coming out of these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to look at them under the microscope, and the <unk> and put them into a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge boats.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream about making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> work with <unk> so that the children are very <unk> they can also be connected.
And I will tell you the kids who manipulate electric tools are cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce the size that we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to focus on something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, it just gives you information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the kids are getting very much with the robots.
And then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned out light and camera cameras in accessories. And they put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating down through the sensor while the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get a distinct estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website to inventors called <unk> with hope that someone will do it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they're trying to fix it immediately.
And to investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are kids very well informed.
You see the news <unk> and the Internet, and you get stuck with this image: you know?
A child, maybe less than 10 years -- cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the world's largest <unk> in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water where the water where they live, the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown, the mud and the oil is also <unk> and when it's all <unk> it's very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be pushed through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what's in the water.
We took this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in a remote way to other children.
I was able to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I was forced to go a little further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half a French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed several cities on the east coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant to Fukushima, a nuclear central power plant to the water.
And today, according to the reports of the average of a 300 metric tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the most part, and the majority of the time, it looks secure, it's blue.
Well, reality is a bit more complicated than that.
I have come back to <unk> every year since the crash and independently independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here, you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take job seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with <unk> all of their life.
Along with them we discuss the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate rain.
We could notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this organized a civil expedition, the nearest nuclear expedition to date.
We get to 1.5 miles of the nuclear power, and with the help of the fishermen from the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a sediment of sediment as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales and also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the harm that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of so much, we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we turn it into the biggest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically, you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of kids can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the old age, transforming their standard wheels on new self-driving cars.
The plastic, the oil, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to care about the environment and the people, and to really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two different <unk>
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one silk thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One kind of imposes on the environment, the other thing he thought of.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the menu, <unk> he saw a figure that fight for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But living things aren't <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we took all the information to do it for every cell for working and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The lines of assembly have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects set up to think of their objects as <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
One acts primarily like <unk> the other mostly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that gets gradually its functionality through variation by <unk>
Here's a broken screen which represents my view of the world and the <unk> personality of every designer and an architect in the work between the <unk> and the organism, between the machine and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and the right, and synthetic and synthesis, is shown on the two screens behind me.
My job in its simplest level, trying to bring these two visions of the world, away from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourselves why now?
Why wasn't it possible for this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they congregate four disciplines that offers designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I started.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools and tools through scales, large-scale structures like this robotic arm with an scope of 24 meters with a base store that some day not far too far to print buildings <unk> <unk> and graphics to nanoscale made of genetically modified <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every aperture is size to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a fashion program of Paris with <unk> <unk> It's like a second skin made of one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing with 3D printing -- we printed this layer and turning it into the cells between the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines stiff and <unk> materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this high resolution <unk> and the instruments, <unk> it allows us to design products that are <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissue.
We also designed an acoustic chair a chair at the same and comfortable and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter teacher -- my collaborator, I went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this pattern of surface <unk> it becomes <unk>
It <unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the points of pressure in the human body.
His surface, as in nature, varies its functionality is not using the addition of other material or other <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Bible <unk> and one of them was stuck and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God reaches the Earth to grow a <unk> tree, <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, land made trees grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made from place.
I often wondered, "What would the design if objects were made of one <unk>
Is it going to be a better state of <unk>
So we looked for the material that is going to fill up the kind of material of the tree that is <unk> with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons they produce every year for organisms like shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We think if we can tune into your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk> -- we asked a lot of <unk> <unk> and we produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the <unk> structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made out of a single new material -- it is 100 percent recyclable <unk>
When the pieces are lists, you keep it dry to find a natural shape in touch with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used for <unk> <unk> which first came in on the planet 3.5 billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and the MIT, <unk> bacteria designed genetically to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that do their transition without <unk> <unk> <unk> and if it broadens even more.
A tree <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet with abundant water and a bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure made of shrimp husks in an architecture that acts like a tree.
And here's the best two: for the objects that are designed to <unk> put them in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, they'll help a tree.
The fits for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the chart <unk> we made our own <unk> new forms of life created -- made up of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- new biological stuff, new biological channels within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, you will get <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
He lives in our oceans and the water ponds with fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
One turns into sugar, the other sugar burning and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but by design.
In order to hold these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the tract.
So we started to grow those canals in the human body, we would take the properties of the material according to the capability of <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> we got more transparent channels.
This <unk> digestive system when you stretch from one end to another, it's 60 feet high.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels and bright channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are particular <unk> only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the living matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, <unk> the tissue hurt and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way to edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer made material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture.
<unk> is not going to be on this level of <unk>
It does it by combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a tension, structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, <unk> in a single material.
With the end of the better understanding of how this complex process, we attach a magnet magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that it <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different environments, and we have discovered that the shape of the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> silk worms to death in their <unk> its silk <unk> and it is used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape raw silk without boiling a single boiling silk one.
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we put this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> by making silk templates and we put us on our site.
We knew that silk silk worms are called the darkest areas and <unk> so we use a <unk> diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, it will be distributed silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We were asking that silk silk silk <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they got eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
The biological silk <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion of integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk silk <unk> <unk> <unk>
On a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional dollars in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us to form a ecology of two materials, the designers must bring together these two visions of the world.
Which leads to a turn, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new age of design, a new era of creation, which leads to a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by us, for the first time that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school, I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and a website and a website and also was playing the guitar on a punk band, called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is not a challenge, it gets to <unk>
And I have to let it.
But then I was struck by another thing, something totally different, something totally different, and I got stuck in it, and I feel <unk> I have found it <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to let it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for no <unk> at all.
I was worried about commitment, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something I'd like to have raised me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where we did it, they learned from culture.
Do you ask ourselves what you want to be <unk>
when we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would belong to that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is happening to us over and over again, as you grow up in various ways, <unk> students in high school asks you to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before you take off the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspires kids to dream with what might be, not inspires to dream with everything that might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, although adults are very smart, and say, "Oh, how nice.
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or true <unk> the idea that every one of us has something that you have something that you have to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different themes that wake up your curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel it alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so say.
It could help if you divide into three <unk> multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms, that you can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time of the Renaissance the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara refers to us as a <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapting to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in its visualization data visualization of data, and design, to <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
By <unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens at intersections.
There comes new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second thing <unk> is fast learning.
When we <unk> them, we are interested in it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to test new things and come out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we need, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> at full time and independent writer and <unk>
As a pianist pianist who said, an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the most quickly <unk>
Before I become a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when he was starting their <unk> and this ability to write compelling <unk> for the editors.
It's rarely a waste of time to go to what you would give you even if at the end of it.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third <unk> <unk> is the adaptability.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of the other -- other newspaper paper, sometimes consultant on Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their customers.
<unk> Magazine Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be allowed to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning, and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills you could lose if you're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest to encourage <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep deep and put in practical practice, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all be designing lives and careers that will reflect on how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a lot of people are told to just be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said that, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope it is this: <unk> with the internal wiring is whatever.
If you are a heart agency, then let's go through all the media.
That's where you get the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including the ones that you just realize will be one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
To follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
Let's get the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman named <unk> led to a psychiatric who was <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately, passed away from <unk>
After his death, he ran a <unk> and they found strange plate and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more surprising.
If you were to have been living today, we could not give it to the most help than you were trying to do it <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in getting a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
Since <unk> medicine has made a lot.
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> lots of treatments for cancer for HIV, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But little has been made on Alzheimer's.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think of this all the time.
Alzheimer's disease is now affecting 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the chance that their years will spend their <unk> or to help take care of a friend or to be dear to Alzheimer's.
In America, Alzheimer's care costs about 200 dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare will spend on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their cost costs a increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little done to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be allowed to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have invested less time and money on the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research than Alzheimer's growth despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs more than Alzheimer's and causes similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know about, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of us will even even have the scientists, Alzheimers Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the <unk> patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe memory loss of mental <unk> the damage to the brain caused significantly reducing life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plate and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
We now know that they're made of different proteins.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There are places in paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, well, these dots are <unk> they end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are left on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> between them, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are lots of steps, and identifying what step block is complex, like a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb out.
You have to figure out the right step that we would do, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of them have dropped the wires and waiting the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> physical <unk> engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's testing a new kind of pharmaceuticals that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened to the test of these drugs in <unk>
These are those worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick with each other inside of them, as in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but the research like this sample Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of waiting -- there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to defeat the Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to argue that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have topped more research and <unk> pressure of governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move forward to HIV treatment at the end of the 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is, in most cases a genetic disease.
All the world with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients now like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They talked about them and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
And I took this article in the column of New York Times, the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience to test it as a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to make 36 questions more and more personal questions and then you both look at your eyes without talking about four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake tomorrow tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number two: When was the last time you ever heard about somebody else's person?
And <unk>
<unk> are increasingly personal.
Number two: <unk> really <unk> me on your partner what you like to do about it, or it would be, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, one detail really called me attention, the gossip that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all the lab to <unk>
So I was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but, of course, also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly well -- I didn't expect <unk>
However, we had <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I would send it to the column -- Love <unk> a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably are wondering, do they go together.
And the reason I think this is questioning this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the paper was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousand of it.
And that came up with a very good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was posted on a Friday night at night, and already the Saturday, this happened on my blog.
And the Sunday, I had been called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received more than eight million <unk> and I was -- to say something, a little bit prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with <unk> about <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been an international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or I wrote what they did every day for weeks, they were always asking the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the <unk> of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came up right away.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman rushed to the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers by testing the study on them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very close to my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both made a public emergence together.
I had television interviews, and <unk> orders from us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons of the <unk> of the <unk> and a range of which I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know whether it really <unk> they want to know whether it was able to produce love <unk> not just an adventure, but real love, love love.
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt, especially that people asked the wrong question.
How do we know if we were going to put together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions at this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, looking for interpersonal zoom in our university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were felt closer after doing doing that several later <unk> several later protocol used by <unk> as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used between the police members and the community and the community used to be between people of political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I proved last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, it was cited in this paper, but unfortunately it never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college, and then a student came to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you get out of the person who was doing it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better to test the research on.
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer I was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that neither of you are looking at when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to almost every adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I took it to science.
And I was doing everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that to be able to kind of be <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just went to the book that I was writing about, but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was fascinated with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as wrong and used to feel like then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or so.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confident to demand what I am.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably <unk>
What I'm looking for love is an actor, not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> in the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media heard about 36 questions is that there may be a short <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some ways to mitigate something of the <unk> and this is a very glamorous story, because fall in love with a beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that question: still follow together?
And his content with a word <unk> or No.
So more than a question, you know, let's ask you more difficult, questions like, How do you decide who you deserve your love and who doesn't?
How are you going to stay in love when things get together, and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that carries one relationship? Or even more, how do you live in doubt of <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a conversation about what it means to love somebody.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still going to get together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> <unk> because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit at reading now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything that you were supposed to do.
I didn't think how many times we would have to make that decision, and how much I will have to continue to do that choice without knowing before he was always going to choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, I have chosen to love someone as generous, kind and fun and having expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe about.
And what you would expect, and what maybe spending my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end of implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually have existed.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a couple of <unk> at full mountain and in a way I got a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York does a time ago,  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and I took it a dollar, a dollar, a <unk> and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species, ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go to ride and do <unk> and all of those things, and I was doing a collage of my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took out all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to Agnes Martin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it is <unk> to them, so I added more resin into the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite: he somehow looked like it grew up as a size, as if it was that they <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, strange bottles that I was finding out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things my whole life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realize that God can draw in space.
I can flow out of <unk> drawing just like it gets around a body on the crime scene.
And I got out of the objects and I created my own taxonomy of deaf individuals.
First of all, you can think of what you can do an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some of money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was cool, man.
At some point I got interested in the human form, sculpture of natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets like drawing on a window, and then on the other window, and another window, and he had all these windows together that forming a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work worked with something very big, I call <unk>
To the <unk> I was inspired by the garden of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a bit ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It's twice a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals travel between two worlds.
You go from the world of representation, like this <unk> <unk> where you <unk>
This is where creatures with animals are heading to the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god, tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is at <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama Bin Laden, and there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
But also a kind of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spitting out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out of it.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's one aspect of <unk>
It's a bit of a story.
That is the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> vessel, a <unk> tail that binds the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on fire to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things that go by, you know.
Your tail ends up in an eye of <unk> made out of terrorists 1986.
You've got them <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
It takes me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six year-old project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material -- online or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of a human being, and they travel in 20, four or 12 at a time.
They are like cells, they come together.
And you can walk between them. I'm bringing years old.
Each one is basically a microscope microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human <unk> in its inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest. I can get back to the <unk>
So I'm going to join you for the rest of the body, there is a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it has, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher for these works because I can't do it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue out there.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> as the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist -- a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a radio, a radio, a radio, a school, a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
And the box and all the people in inside hits each other like particles.
And I think that's how to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box is living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very facts from the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die too soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect on pain, first happens by your stomach, your guts and other organs.
So I'll take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug is going to be effect on the body.
The disadvantage is, though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> to decrease the amount of virus in blood, and increase the tumor <unk>
But they are also known by their side effects of side effects in its negative majority because in time that they take them to get to the current current -- they will be <unk> and worse for the time you take it to fate, which is where it's most important, in the HIV deposit of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't be easily <unk> in the blood of the patients that are being held at the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, behind treatment, the virus is able to wake up and infect new cells <unk>
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs, which is a treatment of life treatment is <unk>
One day, I felt and I thought, "You know, to do the treatment directly to the virus, without the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use <unk> for the care of wounds and surgery and diabetes surgery can be used for anything else, including transport transport for drugs.
In fact, we're using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes that open up and drill extremely small, and closing the cells are infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little laser and a laser beam on the bacterial cell membrane that these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drugs.
The laser goes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk>
We're testing this technology in vitro technology or <unk> plates, but the goal is to take this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is:
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> in the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, he's headed to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while laser is used to maintain the open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to total eradication of HIV from the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all <unk> researcher in our case, a treatment with laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I have studied armed groups of armed groups like terrorists, insurgents as terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
You know, <unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition of violent participation to comparisons not violent.
I do a field job, in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and an actor <unk>
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know that the reasons why they make it, how they do, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed fight and political struggle is <unk>
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the early 1980s, it has also set up a political party -- a social services and a social device.
In the same way, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, as well.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They're multitasking stuff.
We would have a complicated machine machine, <unk> radio stations, TV, Internet channels and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed magazine magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising fundraising fundraising <unk> for example, business companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run in charge of hospitals, put professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population offering something that the state will not be <unk> and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan ripped through the war, or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be understood as we also looked at the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a great price that's high for the population.
But in general, social services means filling up a vacuum, a <unk> gap.
For example, the election victory of 2006 in 2006 of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill together gaps in the government, and they emerge as armed and political groups as armed and political groups, participate in violent fight and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated more sophisticated ones are these organizations, we can less <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It takes part of a territory, and they run all its functions -- collect the trash -- run the trash system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations and <unk> and the more weak of them are states, as in the Middle East, the more intervene in the Middle East and fill that gap.
This is important to governments -- because to counter these groups will have to invest more on the military tools.
<unk> that vacuum vacuum has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand the <unk> groups that we will better understand what incentives to offer the transition from violence to nonviolence violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors don't recognize military power can win some fights, but we don't give us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum vacuum filled with that empty vacuum of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the label of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And therefore I was <unk> as a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in the interviews, people started calling me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and the sex -- as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world, and anger, in particular, it looks perfectly reasonable response.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> who might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as feminist was a <unk> a false word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which begs too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or higher to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
With the time, as I grew up, I started accepting I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
You will do the same paycheck for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use very easy to be able to use and accessible the contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or abstruse <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, we need to have our other <unk>
We are not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition and skills and much more.
We need to figure out these differences and how we care about the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music <unk> all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of yin yang is incredible.
Do you actually have your <unk>
<unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical Talks.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> fairy fairy <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
This problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color of the color, the gay workers, and <unk> for women, white, <unk> and high.
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist feminist feminist idea.
It also happens the following: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it would take perfection.
When we get to <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where they <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider that <unk> before you try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders of the sector, they're afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid of standing up and say, "Yeah, I am <unk> by fear of what that <unk> means for not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to accomplish <unk>
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years it's a <unk> feminist hero.
In the <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this pop star and embracing the feminism of women and the young men who are being feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the cultural critics started the endless debate if we were <unk> it was or not quite a feminist.
It would take his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> benefits of <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much so much.
We're going to go far beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give up to action and be a bit more <unk>
If I hear music <unk> I am creating a lawsuit for artists to be more happy to provide a silver <unk>
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until they need to kill the change affecting their profit.
It certainly is hard.
Why does your music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions make this that it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years old.
These are two girls <unk> <unk> and shiny and also very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
It's where they are being told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option would be made as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as sports, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio radio when we heard songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in the other part when movies are not treating women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports sports where athletes treat their peers, as sacks of <unk>
In any case, men, especially heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, participate in his project, or working with you, until she doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also be able to be included even more like us to be able to be able to overcome the barriers to the decision making.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to people in power and producers and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make great decisions, most brave to create an essential and significant change.
We can also claim to cook our feminism, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist is not going to be a <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, above all, because I thought, my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
A couple of kids would tell me when I was very young, I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
And I would get my voice, and after all, I didn't think I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like me, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown.
I read the words of women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other, I hold the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same.
I hope that we can all be a little brave when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas, last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> for having visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, and over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be fatal for a child with a immune system with an immune system is one of the most easily <unk> diseases.
There is a effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument on autism and vaccines and <unk> disqualified and marked by being a <unk> fraud for the British Medical Medical
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines will pay their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it creates all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence continued to stable just three or four children per 10,000 <unk>
But then, in the '90s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> of fundraising <unk> like <unk> <unk> referred to the autism as an epidemic, as if I could <unk> another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Centers for Disease Control which is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnosis, and <unk> <unk> <unk> to explain these figures <unk>
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks to be on the face of his two years, visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to <unk> why they were so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the evil power of storytelling.
For the most part of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story was being fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more precise story of autism than had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist at Johns <unk> at Johns Hopkins at Johns Hopkins at Johns <unk> and he wrote an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> and private worlds -- people around them, even their own parents.
They could fun during hours he was waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were <unk> of panic panic as when he did not put his favorite toy in his usual standard of knowing them.
Over the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s as the main authority of the world in the subject, he had seen less than 150 real cases of their syndrome as far as <unk> <unk> of places like South Africa.
This is actually not wonder, because the criteria criteria for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned nine in 10 children to his doctor's office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> or cold parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have been carefully carefully at a refrigerator that doesn't exist.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents -- desperate to win their approval approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for the families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist, I thought the theory of <unk> mothers -- I was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John was warm and warm and <unk> and had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard to raise a child like to raise without service services, no special education, and without access to other resources without diagnosis.
To defend ourselves from the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, and their colleague with Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years earlier.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
He took a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse is a lot.
Some kids could not speak at all, while others were going to lie in their fascination with astrophysics, in the dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit very beautiful paintings and <unk> like <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost by trying to make sense of his data.
How no one hadn't seen these kids before?
But then I found a reference to an article published in <unk> in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he was dressed up under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competence, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even one translation to English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he was doing it for her.
The document offers a alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a <unk> clinic with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even in contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic, they started with exercises with music with music, and the kids followed their games for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's was described as <unk> by life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces throughout the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called them his little teachers, and he started to help in the developing methods of education that were especially suited for them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, and they have been, and looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture as the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a hint of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of diagnosis that reflect diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and the early 1990s, their changes in <unk> by replacing the limited model of <unk> by a full and <unk>
These changes don't fell on a broken <unk>
<unk> when we <unk> and Judith worked out to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I was coming out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four prizes for <unk> <unk> psychologists, and parents and parents all over the world knew what autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trial to use to diagnose autism.
I had no longer to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a <unk> effect of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were expected to make people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blaming vaccines for the increase in the diagnostics. A simple, powerful history and <unk> history as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the world's biggest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are going to be solved by the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
A way to understand <unk> is to think about in terms of operational operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't run Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> and it suffers from a deficit deficit to detail.
<unk> people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we are still reaching <unk> which creates the <unk> for the most autism aspects of teachers, employers with ability, communities of support, communities and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the boat of the <unk>
While we go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
